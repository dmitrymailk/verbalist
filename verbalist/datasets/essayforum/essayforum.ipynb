      "In modern society, there has been a major concern about the increasing number of women choosing to delay pregnancy. This essay attempts to depict plausible causes and shed light on both the merits and demerits of this phenomenon.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "In the past, most wives relied on the breadwinner-their husband, and stayed at home to do chores, give birth, and raise their children. Throughout industrial evolution, a number of changes have been made in the role of women in society, in which they have the right to make decisions themselves. Especially in democratic regions, this equality between genders has been considerably enhanced, which decisively raises the awareness of women about their own rights, leading to widespread non-child tendency in this sex. Moreover, due to globalization, the potential opportunities in occupations and education have been expanded to allow numerous women to spend their lifespans taking part in and pursuing their own ambitions and careers.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Regarding the advantages of this change, this delay may significantly improve women's satisfaction and fulfillment on the grounds that they can land the chance to follow their own path instead of the stereotypical lifestyles of the past. It is refutable that the more individuals participate in the job market, the larger the workforce a country has, which then leads to the rising development of a thriving economy. On the other hand, having children late may result in a decline in the annual birth rate of nations, which means the young workforce in the foreseeable future will fall significantly. In addition, owing to the sexual characteristics of women, a number of related health risks are likely to occur if they become pregnant in old age.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "In conclusion, the main precursors to the increasing number of women giving birth late are equality in modern society and the expansion of job and education opportunities. Although this phenomenon bestows enormous advantages upon women and countries through their well-being and contributions to economic growth, it is undeniable that it may result in a fall in birth rates and higher risks to their welfare.\n",

While I acknowledge the good customer service of these housing companies bring for individuals, I absolutely agree with the notion due to the important role of government in providing affordable and reliable housing for people.  \\n  \\nOn the one hand, housing companies could play a crucial role in solving housing issue, which may cause severe consequences in big cities. These companies could provide people with good customer housing service as the existence of these private companies rely on customer satisfaction. Thus, the service of the houses, which were built by these companies, may be better, such as more spacious living place, have security personnel and parking lot. Moreover, residents of such house could easier to lodge their complaint if the companies did not provide them service in contract due to the credibility of these private companies, which is the vital element for their existence, may be tarnished.  \\n  \\nAs the quality also come with price, thus the housing price of these companies can be unaffordable for the low-income people. Therefore, the national authorities still play an important role in providing houses for general people. The government houses are cheaper due to the fact that it was subside by the authorities as the result, make it available for underprivileged people. For example: In communist countries like VietNam house price was subside 10% for the low-income people. Furthermore, the reliability of governmental house is trustworthy as these houses are under the administration of the national authorities. As the result, these houses are protected by the government and people may secure when buying these houses  \\n  \\nIn conclusion, despite the good customer service that the private housing companies can provide for people, nothing could replace the authorities' role in solving housing problems as they could provide houses for a general people. However, it is ideal to provide houses, made by government and housing companies, as people can have more options to choose an appropriate house  \\n  \\nThank you\",\n",
