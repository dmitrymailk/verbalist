This is especially important for cases with only marginal differences, as for example the comparison between BERT and XLM (Section 4.2): Here, the difference in MAE is probably not significant.\\n\\n- The results are not discussed in relation to previous approaches for the task (especially regarding work on the challenge from 2021). In order to highlight the significance of the work, the authors should point out which results agree with previous findings, and which are novel.\\n \\n- The performance of the best model is only marginally better than the mean baseline as reported in the challenge (MAE 5.72 vs. 5.73) and substantially worse than the mean baseline taking into account the target language (MAE 4.27). The authors do not discuss the performance of their models with respect to this baseline. It would be interesting to analyze why even the best of all 48 different models perform that poorly. Is it because of the high variance of feature values between the languages? Would these models perform better if they were trained and evaluated only on one language?\\n\\n## Minor\\n\\n### Abstract\\n- effects: affects\\n- lesser: smaller\\n\\n### Introduction:\\n- Missing reference for “Huggingface”\\n\\n### Results:\\n- Table 2 &3: Wouldn’t it be more infromative to report scores for the best performing model, instead of average over all tested models?\\n- The results presented in Figure 1 and 2 could be presented in Tables, as they show only 4 and 2 data points.

The shared task contains two challenges. Subtask 1 requires the participants to predict the features in 6 provided langauges (zh, hi, ru, en, nl, de), and subtask 2 involves a new language (dk). This paper describes the dataset, preprocessing steps, the scoring metric, and the baseline methods.

       "     'review': '### Summary\\nThis paper describes the NU-HLT system in CMCL 2022 shared task. This system is inspired by both classical and recent previous works in speech recognition systems. First, the raw terms are transformed into a global shared space using IPA. Then, some features, including the frequency, length, N-gram, and information-theoretic features are extracted. Specifically, there are two psycholinguistically-motivated features: imageability and concreteness. Four ML algorithms from WEKA (LinReg, MLP, RF, kNN) are used to train to predict the FFDAvg and TRTAvg scores. Additionally, top predictor features with their correlation coefficients are identified.\\n\\n### Reasons to accept\\n- The description of the system is clear. The hyperparameters including learning rate and the number of iterations are reported, allowing easy reproduction of the results.\\n- The idea of transforming into IPA turns out to be novel and effective for predicting the FFDAvg and TRTAvg tasks.\\n\\n### Reasons to reject\\nI see no serious issues with this paper.\\n\\n### Comments\\n- The reporting of some results could be improved. E.g., in Table 1, there are many mentions of `k`, `m`. What do they mean?  \\n- Table 2: highest correlation coefficients. Do you mean \"highest absolute correlation coefficients\"? Some numbers are negative there.  \\n- Probably an additional feature selection procedure can be useful for further improving the predicting performance.\\n- Reference: Some entries have urls, but the remaining do not.

They created a dataset for French in addition to the available test set for English and create a qualitative dataset to zoom into particular cases.\\n\\nThe experimental set up allows us to see the contribution of several factors individually. For example,  by showing results for unseen vs seen verbs, the contribution of verb-specific knowledge becomes clear.

I think this is due to the fact that many tendencies in the results are not explained. For example you mention ‘Examining the probability distribution of the two labels, all models were very confident in classifying sentences, regardless of their accuracy. This to me is a bad sign. The models should be less confident in cases when they are making the incorrect choice if they have actually learned someting. Also, the results on French are worse.

Perhaps a simple baseline based on surface cues that the systems could outperform could take away these concerns. Or perhaps the task could be rephrased. Instead of a simple binary decision task, the model could be probed for its understanding of the telicity and durational aspects.\\n\\nThe authors make no specific reference to cognitive theory.

       "    'content': {'title': \"A look at aspect in transformers: it's probably there but it's not clear how\",\n",
       "     'review': 'This paper explores the question of whether sentential embeddings derived from pre-trained language models support the classification of aspect. The paper reports experiments on categorizing two types of aspectual information in English and French using a variety of pre-trained transformer architectures, together with some baseline models. The results point to a positive conclusion, though it is interesting to note that the results in cases where the verb is not explicitly labeled do not represent all that much of an improvement over previous models (Friedrich and Gateva report an F1 of about 76%, which is just a hair lower than most of the no verb cases reported in Figure 10). I appreciated the paper\\'s contribution, though I think it would benefit from a few modifications.\\n\\n1. I was very interested to read the discussion of the qualitative patterns in the results. However, I found it difficult to extract any general lessons about how the transformers were doing the tasks. The specific deficits that were uncovered in the qualitative analysis could be further probed, by breaking down the quantative results  along a variety of dimensions. For example, it would be revealing to break the results down by aspectual category (e.g., are telic or atelic sentences classified better?), by structure (e.g., are past tense or present tense sentences better classified wrt telicity? what about sentences with definite or indefinite objects?), and by corpus (given that each one was skewed toward one or the other of the categories).  Doing this might allow us to begin to more systematically understand how these complex models are going about the task and why the qualtitative patterns you observed are as they are. I\\'d like to know for instance how argument definiteness compares as a cue as compared to adverbial type as compared to verb tense as compared to the lexical semantics of the verb.  \\n\\n2. The description of the experiment was not as complete as I would have liked. How was classification done? Specifically, during finetuning, which embedding was used to do classification? Was it the [CLS] token or the verb embedding, and if the latter, what happened in cases where the verb was divided into multiple tokens? Were the embeddings averaged?\\n\\n3. The discussion of aspect in the paper isn\\'t entirely clear on the distinction between aspect that is lexically determined and that which is the result of structural context (e.g., the properties of the object, adverbial modifiers, or inflectional morphology). The paper doesn\\'t make explicit which of these is being targeted in the classification task discussed in the paper. I would have thought it was the latter, given some of the test cases (in Table 3 we see that \"eat\" can be either telic or atelic depending on its object). However, some of the comments in the paper lead me to think otherwise: \"it has been annotated for telicity and duration based on the verb\\'s aspect\" (line 182), \"aspect is generally attributed to the verb\" (line 215). It would be helpful to clarify this, and to be clear about what diagnostics are being assumed to characterize each of the aspectual categories under discussion. Providing some more detailed characterization of the categories would be particularly helpful in the case of \"duration\", as it wasn\\'t clear to me what the distinction was -- is it between states and activities (possibly habitual)? Is there a third category of non-durative predicates? \\n\\n4. I am skeptical that the translation-generated French dataset is sufficiently reliable as to produce interpretable results. Moreover the qualitative assessment didn\\'t reveal any particularly clear generalizations that we can compare with those from English (where the results of the qualitative evaluation were similarly mixed). Moreover, the fact that the results of the pre-trained models was no better than the CNNs makes me worry that they are suffering from a mismatch between the pre-training data and the odd sentences in the aspectual fine-tuning data. Though I am in general quite pleased to see work that compares results across multiple languages, it might not be a bad idea to leave these French results aside until better data sets can be obtained.  \\n\\nSpecific comments:\\n\\nline 167: The procedure for creating the silver annotations in Friedrich and Gateva\\'s dataset strikes me as possibly poblematic. Do we know how reliable it is in producing labels that English speakers agree with? Has this been checked in previous work?\\n\\nline 226: I don\\'t understand the use of token_type_ids. Is this to specify which embeddings are used for classification? Or does this information get fed into the model so that it facilitate classication? The latter clearly seems like cheating, since we might have expected that the language model would learn about the importance of the verb for aspectual classifcation without any explicit annotation of the verb. And even the former doesn\\'t seem ideal -- shouldn\\'t we be able to classify the entire predicate (or even he entire sentence) as, say, telic or atelic, as compared to the word itself.\\n\\nTable 1: the differing skew with respect to the duration categories in the datasets is quite striking. As the paper notes, the model could sensibly try to solve this task by determining which corpus it comes from. Do you have a sense that this has happened to any degree? Does it perform worse on durative examples from Friedrich than it does on those from Captions (and vice versa for statives)? Also, why don\\'t the number of labels for telicity equal the number of labels for duration?  Are some sentences only marked for one or the other?\\n  \\nLine 339: What contectual embedding did you use if more than one token is associated with the verb (in the case of subword tokenization)?\\n\\nFootnote 4: What is the measure of translation accuracy? Entire sentence correctness? Is there a correlation between problematic translations and problematic classification of aspect?\\n\\nLine 397: Do you have any ideas on why the BERT models yielded more categorical classifcations for aspect (but not duration) as compared to the others?\\n\\nline 471: Any idea about what made this case difficult? \\n\\nline 485: Any thoughts on why?\\n\\nline 494 et seq: Again any thoughts on why?\\n\\nline 517 (Figure 3): The differences across layers are pretty small. Should we take this to suggest that this classification task can be done using fairly superficial features, such as verb form. Also, it wasn\\'t clear to me whether this probing study was done using the fine-tuned model or not. If not, what do you make of the fact that the results are nearly as good as those obtained from fine-tuning?\\n\\nline 542: An alternative interpretaion (which doesn\\'t necessarily implicate the use of context) is that the input embedding of the unseen verb is relevantly similar to verbs on which the classifier was trained.\\n',\n",

Additionally, this correlation was found to be weak on data where participants had to respond to questions after reading sentences.\\n\\nI thought it was very well written paper. Tha authors do a wonderful job in stating the assumptions, in describing the hypothesis, situating their work in the previous literature as well as in discussing the results.\\n\\nMy key concern is with regard to the interpretation of the correlation and indeed, with the hypothesis of relating attention in transformers with human overt attention (operationalized via gaze duration/dwell time). This is because of the underlying nature of the model like BERT -- the authors state \"Its bidirectional structure means that each word token is placed in the context of the entire sequence instead of just the tokens appearing before it.\" Now, it seems to me that while such a mechanism could be used to model grammatical knowledge but it\\'s difficult for me to understand how it could model an online process such as overt attention. This is because when English native speakers read a word in a sentence they have very limited access to the context on the right of a word that they are fixating. It is true that the authors are modeling gaze duration (rather than a measure like first fixation duration) which implies that the measure captures reading time due to regressions as well (i.e., looking at the word again after accessing right context), but we know that regressions are rare during reading. So, regressions being rare while typical reading implies that reading doesn\\'t involve use of right context. Can this be said of the models being use to model overt attention? Indeed, given the nature of how BERT works one would expect the correlations to be in fact stronger in cases where reading involves active search for information (i.e., when reading to answer questions). This is because one could expect more rereading in such a setting.\\n\\nSo, my main concern is that the \\'overt attention\\' - \\'transformer attention\\' link that has been established in this paper is rather tenuous and in my understanding theoretically weak. I would request the authors to at least acknowledge this limitation of the work in the final draft, if the paper were to get accepted. The authors state that \"... this paper will present experimental evidence of a link showing the relationship between the two.\" I suggest that the author qualify the nature of this link; as it is currently stated, the use of the word \\'link\\'  implies process parallelism which as discussed above is very misleading.\\n',\n",

       "     'review': ' ## Overall\\n \\nThis paper analyzes the degree of correspondence between human eye fixation patterns during text reading and the attention distributions of pretrained transformer language models. Results show an overall high degree of correlation between model-generated attention weights and human gaze distributions across transformer architectures and layers, suggesting that transformers may converge via pretraining on a relatively human-like assessment of the importance of words in texts. Although I have some concerns about framing and methods, I think this paper should be of interest to computational psycholinguistics.\\n\\n\\n## Major\\n\\n- Framing and motivation leave something to be desired. First, attention in the deep learning toolkit and attention as a cognitive process happen to be referred to with the same word in English, but that doesn\\'t entail that the relationship between them is inherently scientifically interesting. The authors\\' assumed stance on the relationship between these two constructs is confusingly presented: the first sentence of the paper implies that both attentions are considered to be the same thing, whereas the first sentence of the 2nd par implies that they are \"appear to be completely different\". In reality, \"attention\" in DNNs is a cognitively inspired architectural innovation that improves task performance but whose role in the model\\'s reasoning process is not well understood (e.g. Jain & Wallace 19, Serrano & Smith 19), let alone its relationship to human cognition. The paper would benefit from a clearer framing of the constructs under investigation. Second, why does the relationship between model and human attention matter? What do we learn about models or humans from a particular level of correlation between attention weights and eye gaze? To be clear, I\\'m *not* saying that these questions don\\'t matter, only that it\\'s on the authors to explain what\\'s at stake. The paper dives right into the details without clearly setting up the questions that the authors want to answer.\\n\\n- Human gaze distributions were averaged prior to analyses. Because reading patterns are known to be highly variable across individuals, I think this is a serious weakness. In particular, it may lead to an exaggerated impression of human-model similarity by eliminating a major source of variation in the eye movement record. More realistic estimates could be derived from e.g. regression models of detailed (unaveraged) fixation distributions given model attention proportions, ideally in a mixed effects design. In addition, interpretation is made difficult by the absence of baselines. How good is 0.6 Spearman correlation, and what drives the correlations? Without controls, it\\'s hard to say whether this is really about the model\\'s learned attention vs less interesting phenomena that attention may merely reflect in some way, like the length or frequency of words.\\n\\n- This paper surveys a lot of the models in the huggingface inventory but the absence of GPT (and variants) is a liability, especially since GPT is one of the only SOTA transformer LMs that respects incrementality (a constraint faced by human readers) and produces representations that are substantially more similar to the human brain response to language than many of the other models considered here (Schrimpf et al 21, cited here). GPT is available from the same software library as the others -- why was it omitted?\\n\\n- Several critical claims are made based on numerical differences without direct statistical comparison. For example, none of the following claims are directly supported quantitatively:\\n    - Lower layers are better correlated with human gaze than higher layers\\n    - There is no relationship between the size of the model and attention-gaze correlation (this one actually isn\\'t quantified at all, e.g. via correlation between nparams and spearman corr)\\n    - BERT is better overall than the other models\\n    - Attention-gaze correlations are higher during free (vs task-directed) reading\\n    - Lower layers model eye movement control whereas middle layers model specific language processing operations\\n\\n\\n## Minor\\n\\n- Rai & Le Callet 2018 is a suboptimal single citation to provide for the overt-covert attention distinction. Posner 1980 would be better.\\n- Fig 1 is hard to interpret. Sure, many maxima are in early layers, but there are plenty of exceptions, and many from the highest layers. What\\'s the pattern? How different are the layers from each other? A distribution would be a lot more informative here.\\n- Ettinger 20 is cited as a study about eye movements vs machines, but they didn\\'t look at eye movements. This cite should either be removed, or the context should be rephrased.\\n- This paper is heavily inspired by Sood et al 20 and cites it frequently, but the presentation of that earlier work is strange. In particular, it\\'s never said clearly enough that this paper is asking a different question from Sood et al 20. Sood et al 20 asked whether *model performance* on a QA task was anticorrelated with the *similarity* between model attention distributions and human gaze distributions. They showed that models that do well on the QA task have more similar attention distributions to humans, which is not the same as this paper\\'s question about the *overall similarity* of human and model attention, independent of task. This is why Sood et al\\'s associations are negative, which is an otherwise confusing outcome as presented here. It\\'s also not clear why the authors feel beholden to account for \"departures\" of their findings from Sood et al\\'s results at the start of S3.3. I\\'m glad this resulted in some interesting error analysis about the importance of normalizing over sentences vs paragraphs (though see next point), but I don\\'t understand the reason for the question in the first place -- Sood et al and this paper are analyzing different things in response to different questions, so why would the results be expected to be the same?\\n- The finding that model-human correlations are higher when normalizing over sentences vs paragraphs is presented as a puzzle and the authors speculate that model-human alignment may degrade with longer texts. However, the texts and model attention distributions are the same in both analyses (only the domain of normalization changes), so this explanation doesn\\'t make sense to me. Plus isn\\'t matching at the level of paragraphs strictly harder than matching at the level of sentences, since at the paragraph level, the model needs to reproduce the gaze distribution of each component sentence (i.e. the sentence-level task) *and* the overall proportion of gaze across sentences? So I think the degradation when normalizing over paragraphs just falls out from sentences being substrings of paragraphs. Which domain of normalization is more appropriate depends on the scientific question, which isn\\'t fully spelled out here (see major point 1).\\n- The paper puts all description of datasets in the appendix, but some high level description should be provided in the main text, especially since they go on to analyze differences between datasets/tasks in S3.3.\\n- There are known potential problems with averaging bounded variables like normalized attention distributions: because the bound isn\\'t taken into account in the average, values in the center of the range can have an excessive influence, and the degree of concentration toward the extremes can be poorly estimated. In the domain of Pearson correlation, this is often handled with Fisher transformation. Have the authors considered and tried to address possible influences of edge effects on their results?\\n- To compute model attention distributions, averages were first taken across attention heads and token-level attention distributions, and then the weights on subword tokens were averaged to bring the tokenization into alignment with reading experiments. But it seems like a more principled method would first *sum* the attention weights allocated to each subword before any other averaging, since this sum represents the total proportion of attention allocated to the entire word.',\n",

       "     'review': '## Overall\\n\\nThis paper shows via computational simulations that the Tolerance Principle (TP; Yang 05), a theory of rule learning in child language acquisition, can explain previously attested uniformity across child learners of English in (a) which morphological patterns are acquired as productive rules and (b) the timecourse of rule acquisition. The TP defines a deterministic threshold over the proportion of exceptions that can be \"tolerated\" by a productive rule. Under the assumptions of the TP, the authors show empirically that rules may move in and out of productivity during learning due to variation in the relative number of exceptions learned, that the shape of these learning trajectories is influenced by the token frequencies of exceptions, and that simulations using data-driven token frequencies roughly replicate the timecourse of rule learning attested in studies of child language learning.\\n\\nThe writing and interpretation are generally clear, the motivation and methods are sound, and the results support the conclusions. I think this work is appropriate for CMCL, although the breadth of interest may be limited by how embedded it is within a particular theory (Yang 05).\\n\\n\\n## Major\\n\\n- The TP framework assumed by this work takes for granted that children tasked with morphological rule learning can already (1) unambiguously segment words in running speech, (2) correctly identify the types of these segmented words as well as any lexical features that could be used to define domains of rules (e.g. syntactic category), and (3) conduct a global search over their entire vocabulary and hypothesized rule set each time a new word is learned, since this is required in order to determine (a) which words fall under the domain of application of each rule and (b) how many of these are exceptional, in order to decide whether to retain the rule according to the tolerance principle. No attempt is made here to show that the TP is more successful than some alternative theory at explaining a set of facts, so the results may be of limited interest to readers who reject one or more of these assumptions.\\n- About 1/3 of the introduction is dedicated to discussing classical U-shaped trajectories (overregularization) from the acquisition literature, but this work isn\\'t about overregularization. Neither the TP itself nor the computational simulations conducted here concern whether/when a learned rule will be incorrectly applied to an exception. The only question at issue here is when rules are learned in the first place (which certainly could be a necessary condition for overregularization, but not the whole story). Likewise, the abstract concludes that the study shows the TP underlies cross-linguistic differences in learning trajectories, but this again seems like a red herring. This study only uses data from English past tense verb morphology and says nothing directly about cross-linguistic variation. Sure, the result implies that languages with different token frequencies will have different trajectories, but whether this model replicates any known cross-linguistic differences is never evaluated. Thus, the framing of the abstract+intro seems to set up different questions than the ones the authors ultimately address.\\n\\n## Minor\\n\\n- The mathematical notation in S3.1 confusingly overloads variable names. In reality, there are 4 quantities involved: (a) the true in-domain vocabulary size, (b) the true number of exceptions, (c) the infant\\'s vocabulary size at a particular point in learning (the sample size parameter of the hypergeometric distribution), and (d) the number of exceptions learned by the infant at a particular point in processing (the support of the hypergeometric distribution). But the authors use $N$ to refer to both (a) and (c) and $e$ to refer to both (b) and (d), so I had to puzzle over that section for a while in order to figure out how the hypergeometric distributions were being parameterized and thus what the plots were representing. Clearer notation would be helpful.\\n- The plot axes (e and N-e) are a bit of a head trip because they both depend on e. Why not plot e vs N? Barring that, I was able to get my head around the plots by mentally relabeling the y axis as \"Num irregular\" and the x axis as \"Num regular\". Revising the axis labels along these lines would clarify things a lot.',\n",

       "     'review': 'The paper proposes to explain uniformity in children\\'s language learning despite possible differences in individual learning trajectories. The authors investigate these ideas using the Tolerance Principle (TP) (Yang, 2016).\\n\\nI think the idea is interesting and the use of TP is a good way to approach this question. I do however have several comments/concerns that the authors need to address before they consider a publication.\\n\\n-First, I am sure if CMLC is a suitable venue since the paper does not use computational linguistic methods\\n\\n-While TP is a very simple concept, its description in the paper is extremely convoluted and unintuitive. Besides, the authors made use of highly ambiguous word choice and phrasing that impedes understanding for people who are not familiar with TP. To illustrate, the caption in Figure 1 says \"If e lies below θ, then the learner should acquire *it* and memorize the exceptions\" here the reader would think that *it* refers to \"e\" whereas it should refer to the \"productive rule\" (which is not mentioned at all in the caption). The authors also talk about the \"sing-sang\" pattern, which is highly confusing. The pattern they mean is not sing-sang but \"-ing -> -ang\". Sing-sang is an example, but the author never makes this clear. I highly recommend the author to rewrite several parts of the paper to make it understandable. As is, the writing is unnecessarily cryptic and does not allow readers to understand what the authors are doing.\\n\\n-The authors do several simulations that are in my opinion totally unnecessary: the formula is extremely simple, and does not require more clarification through simulations. In fact, these simulations are counter-productive because they are harder to understand than the formula itself!\\n\\n-In my opinion, the only aspect of this work that is slightly novel is the fact of presenting words with different frequency distribution and showing that this leads to different learning trajectories. However, here again, I am afraid the result is obvious and doesn\\'t require simulations. It is discussed in more intuitive terms in Yang 2016 and subsequent work and the concept of \"transient\" periods in learning trajectories is talked about lengthily. \\n\\nSure, if you do some weird sampling of words (by selecting the lowest frequency, lowest and highest, etc;.) you end up with different transient modes, but these are not insightful about real development since the sampling performed by the author is extreme/artificial and does not correspond to variability in the order of acquisition in children. It would have been more interesting if the authors took real longitudinal vocab acquisition (for example using http://wordbank.stanford.edu/) and showed there to be real variability in transient periods of productive vs. unproductive rule depending on variability in order of word learning of real children.\\n\\nThe part about CHILDES is completely disconnected from everything else. The authors use only one learning trajectory of how vocabulary grows, so we don\\'t see any variability in the learning trajectory. In fact, this part is just duplicating the work in Yang 2016 who used exactly the same phenomena (i.e.,  the -ed rule vs. ing-ang) and the same CHILDES data.\\n\\nTo conclude, while I am sympathetic to the underlying ideas, the work does not make a solid case for it or present anything that we don\\'t already know. In my opinion, the simulations only muddy the water (sorry!) instead of adding insights. Instead of simulations, I really encourage the author to use real data of variability in children learning trajectories and study the extent to which it follows the predictions of TP. \\n ',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper models the relationship of child language input distributions on learning trajectories. This work is based on a cognitively motivated type-based learning model known as the Tolerance Principle that estimates a threshold of minimum exceptions to a linguistic pattern that are allowed for the language learner to productively use (and presumably influence decision-making and learning) a generalization in the grammar (in contrast to just memorizing individual items). The TP model has previously been used to account for inter-learner uniformity or how children acquire the same grammatical rules despite different learning input/environments (e.g., lexical variation).  \\n\\nThe authors show that the TP model accurately predicts how the type distribution of irregulars governs the overall learning outcome in line with previous work showing it can account for inter-learning uniformity. However, the novelty of this paper is in using the TP model to quantitatively assess how input distributions may drive variation in developmental learning trajectories. Specifically, how the token distribution (relative token frequencies or the order of acquisition of regular and irregular items) can lead to different learning trajectories. \\nThe authors show this capability through an example using three different distributions of irregulars and their dramatic impact on the learning trajectory. They then show an application to real-world data mainly showing how this model can be used to quantify (visualize) the learning trajectories of the productive English past tense (the default past -ed) and the unproductive sing-sang sub-pattern drawing on CHILDES database.  \\n\\nThis has potential application towards quantitatively assessing how variation in input distributions accounts for observed cross-linguistical developmental learning trajectories. It would be great if the authors could give a specific example of this if the space allows for it as it would give the paper more breadth. I would also be interested in understanding how (if) this modeling approach could be extended to the developmental learning of larger linguistic structures (e.g., constructions or other)? \\n\\nThe theoretical description of the TP model and application to understanding how input distributions can impact developmental trajectories is very well explained. However, I think a little more effort should be spent in explaining how the different graphs/visualizations were created. Additionally, sometimes graphs are not referenced explicitly in the text such as in 3.1 in the last paragraph the authors reference a figure indirectly by simply stating “The second illustration demonstrates this”. I think a bit of clean up in these areas and making sure the graph/visualizations are clearly explained despite space constraints will greatly benefit this paper overall. \\n\\nSmall edits: In 3.1 there is a typo, mainly “If irregulars are distributed uniformly [throughout] the distribution of types…” should replace “If irregulars are distributed uniformly [through out] the distribution of types…”.\\n',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper recycles the log-bilinear model (LBL), in a clever way to estimate bilexical co-occurrence probabilities using word embeddings. The motivation behind this work is that estimating word pair probabilities is often difficult due to the sparse nature of this data. Yet, having accurate word pair probabilities is relevant when conducting psycholinguistic experiments that evaluate usage-based cognitive language models (also likely in neurolinguistics it could be used as a useful baseline when trying to understand/evaluate the performance of word embeddings in decoding neural language activity in the brain). The authors propose to re-use the log-bilinear model from Mnih and Hinton 2007, arguably the simplest of neural language models, to estimate word-pair probabilities, specifically, by using as input to the LBL pre-trained static word embeddings (fastText word-vectors).\\n\\nThe performance of the LBL model is examined across four different languages (Arabic, English, Spanish, and Korean) while controlling for the size of the training data. They specifically look at predicting the distribution of attributive adjectives given nouns and nominal direct objects given verbs. The results are convincing with the log-bilinear model outperforming several baselines (i.e., lower negative log\\nlikelihood). Particularly revealing is that it also consistently did better than a softmax distribution on target words as a function of the context word embedding (or when only using a word embedding for the context not the target word) confirming the utility of using word embeddings. I imagine that due to the light-weight nature of this model it would be of particular interest to language\\nresearchers in cognitive science. The authors are also planning on making the code (trained model) available after publication. The only issue I have is that the paper doesn’t really address the sparse nature problem they originally used to partially motivate this work. To this extent, it would be good to note if the authors observed any significant performance advantages when changing the size of the\\ntraining data set (compared to the baselines)? It would be good to give users a rough guideline on these metrics so that this model can be properly used (also performance using other common word embeddings other than fastText).\\n\\nTypo: Page 4, Section 4.3 Results, “These is perhaps not surprising…” should be “This is perhaps not surprising”.',\n",

       "     'review': \"This paper proposes a way to estimate word co-occurrence probabilities by leveraging word embeddings. The method uses a log-linear bilinear model that had been proposed by Mnih and Hinton some time ago, but marries it with pre-trained word embeddings that are derived from a much larger corpus, and which are not specialized to specific types of word co-occurrence. The results are fairly impressive: the trained model yields lower negative log likelihood in all cases, as compared to a number of other baselines. Overall, I found the approach sensible, if not groundbreaking, and the evaluation reasonably compelling.  I have a couple of points I'd like to raise:\\n\\n1. There is considerable variation in performance across the languages (In the adj-noun case, Korean is uniformly the best performing, and . Arabic and Spanish the worst, though there is some variation across models. Things are different in the verb-object case.) Does this stem from the differently-sized test sets (I am assuming that the training data were identically sized across languages), or from differences in the fasttext embeddings (perhaps stemming from differences in training data again), or from differences in the languages, or something else? It would be helpful for the paper to say something about this. For one thing, it would be useful to give sizes of the datasets, as well as measures of the number of distinct context and target words. \\n\\n2. The paper starts by talking about the cognitive utility of having estimates of co-occurrence probability, and the difficulty of doing that in the context of limited (parsed) data. It would be helpful to know the degree to which the proposed method is doing better in contexts of limited data.  In particular, it would be interesting to know how performance of the different models varies as the training data changes in size. For models that can do better with less data, we'd expect to see convergence with smaller datasets.  It would also be useful to know just how well the different models can do in the limit, if we give them limitless data (or nearly as much as we have). Part of the lower performance might be due to difficulty in parameter estimation, and part might be due to the structure of the model, so it'd be useful to know the degree to which the proposed method is really solving the sparse data problem.  \\n\\n3. Given that this is for CMCL, I'd like to have seen some discussion about the cognitive plausibility of the approach. it is commonly thought that word embeddings represent lexical semantics, but clearly similar meaning will not be sufficient to capture co-occurence probability (as in cases of differences in register, or word collocations). Instead, the important property of word embeddings that is being exploited here is that they are derived exactly from attempts to predict co-occurrence. From that perspective, should we expect that any specific way of deriving word embeddings would perform better than another?  \\n\\nSpecific comments:\\n\\nline 61: why can't we use a language model to get predicted adjectives by renormalizing the predicted distribution to limit the support to the same 20k adjectives you look at here? How do the distributions we get in this way from existing large language models (e.g., GPT-3 or BERT) compare to what we get here?\\n\\nline 204: why these hyper parameters?\\n\\nline 282: what does it mean that nouns are more open class? That there are more of them? If so, say that. They are both clearly open class.\",\n",

       "     'review': 'This is a well-written paper; the authors clearly lay out the objective, the previous work on the topic, and their contribution. However, the reported performance increases are very modest, and some methodological choices are unclear. Overall, I think this paper is appropriate for CMCL if the authors adjust the framing and provide some clarifications.\\n\\n1.\\tThe main claim is that concatenating word2vec and visual (ResNet) activations will improve interpretation (classification) of compound nouns by providing additional semantic information. However, the actual increases are very small (an average of 1% or less). It would be helpful if the authors acknowledged that the increases are actually quite modest. Moreover, Table 5 in the appendix shows that comparable performance gains can be observed even in cases where the nouns do not have a visual representation (so their final representation is word2vec + zeros). Thus, the utility of visual representations remains debatable.\\n2.\\tImageNet representations are obtained by averaging representations of several images. Has that been shown to be a useful approach for representing visual concepts? I would imagine that even if providing visual information is beneficial, averaging several distinct image vectors might make the visual representation less useful than it could have been if, say, the most prototypical image was chosen (this might depend on the specific object type too, e.g. less concrete objects are likely more visually diverse).\\n3.\\tI don’t quite get the way the Full Additive Model was implemented. Were the x, y, and z vectors pretrained word2vec vectors? More generally, you state toward the beginning that the goal is to learn a way to represent compounds compositionally, yet if the compound is frequent enough to have its own ground truth representation (z), doesn’t it violate the compositionality premise? \\n4.\\tIs there a reason why visual reps alone aren’t used for classification? Seems like a useful baseline.\\n5.\\tThe authors address the question of whether word concreteness affects their results by (a) examining how many imagenet images each word is associated with, (b) performing additional tests of whether image availability and concreteness affects classification accuracy. However, a key question here seems to be addressed only indirectly: do compounds with concrete words benefit more from adding visual representations? This could be done by dividing the compounds into 2 groups, concrete and abstract, and examining whether the benefits of adding visual reps vary between these two groups. Alternatively, the tests in Table 6 can be complemented by an explicit comparison of relative concreteness effects in L and VL modalities. The question of whether adding image vectors benefits only highly concrete words arose for me as soon as I read the title/abstract, so I think it’d be important to address it a bit more.\\n',\n",

       "     'review': \"This paper investigates whether and to what extent augmenting linguistic representations with visual representations can improve a system's classification of noun-noun compounds (NNCs). NNCs come from the Tratz (2011) data set. They try a few different ways of combining the linguistic and visual representations.\\n\\nI appreciated that they specified several data splits up front: course vs fine-grained labels, and train/dev/test splits controlling for both the modifier and head members of the NNCs. This allows, in theory, for a lot of interesting comparison and analysis.\\n\\nOne major challenge which the authors faced was how to match up images from ImageNet with the Tratz NNCs. They present an algorithm to do this which seems reasonable, but is still quite approximate. This bring this up again in the conclusion. My worry is that their results might be greatly affected by their matching heuristic rather than the problem at hand, and while this is a great topic for a follow-up, I wish they had addressed it in this paper. I believe it is more critical than they made it out to be.\\n\\nThey present F1 scores for a family of 3 baseline models which take majority classes of the entire compound, head, or modifier in the training data. Providing a sensible baseline is something that is often skipped these days, so I appreciated this. \\n\\nThey test a concatenate and an additive model for combining ResNet visual representations with word2vec linguistic representations. \\n\\nThey find similar but not identical results for the additive and concatenative model. The latter performed slightly better on average, and in both cases they generally outperform word2vec alone. I was a bit surprised when I got to the results though, because +ResNet really is only a little bit better than word2vec alone. It seemed kind of incongruous with the big claims made in the prose of the paper. It's sort of trivial to assume that including additional informative data (as through ResNet) should help performance if it's combined correctly, and that is what we see from the results. So my question is, are these results dramatic enough to be interesting? And why aren't they better? Was it because of the matching heuristic?

       "     'review': 'This paper discusses disadvantages of a frequentist ITPC analysis (such as loss of statistical power, no full characterization of the structure of the data) of frequency-tagged EEG data, and introduces a Bayesian model as a novel alternative. \\nThe model includes:\\n* a wrapped Cauchy distribution as a model of the data (a set of angles drawn from a unimodal probability distribution on the circle)\\n* a prior for the mean phase for each participant-electrode-condition triplet as a uniform on a circle\\n* a condition-dependent prior for the scale parameter of the distribution, resulting in different mean resultants\\n \\nThe authors show that the posterior distributions yielded by this model give a richer and more complete picture of the data than the original frequentist ITPC analysis.\\n \\n**General**\\n\\nThe paper is clearly written and of theoretical interest to the community. The characterization of the data derived via the analysis allows for interesting new conclusions that were not detectable using the ITPC method, which are relevant to the original research question. As someone without a background in EEG time-series analysis, the proposed Bayesian model nevertheless strikes me as straightforward and well-motivated. To make the novel contribution of the paper even stronger I suggest a discussion of how this approach compares to a mixed-effects model, which can also model the random effects in the data that ITPC as a summary statistic glosses over.\\n \\n**Specific questions/Comments**\\n* One thing that wasn’t clear to me from the write-up is how the simplifying assumption of choosing independent location parameters per participant-electrode-condition triplet instead of per participant-electrode pair affects the model results (lines 144ff).\\n* I would have liked to see the unabbreviated names for all 6 conditions somewhere in the paper, especially since the ML condition for which the model provides a novel result in relation to RR is not listed as an experimental condition in the Burroughs et al. (2021) paper; The same is true for the RV condition, but this name is more transparent given the other conditions. I assume ML and RV correspond to the two extra conditions described as fillers in the Methods section of Burroughs et al. (2021), and analyzed in Figure 2 of their Supplementary Materials, where RV = RRRV and ML = ADVP, but it would be good to make this correspondence clear. Furthermore, if this alignment is correct it may be good to discuss a potential effect of these two streams having 12 four-word phrases instead of 24 two-word phrases as the other conditions on the critical ML-RR modeling results.\\n \\nOverall, I think this paper provides an interesting contribution and I am looking forward to seeing the full description of the different Bayesian models and their robustness advertised at the end of the paper.',\n",

The analysis is meant to serve as an alternative to a traditional frequentist analysis from prior works, which averages over electrodes and items instead of explicitly accounting for associated variance.\\n\\nMain contributions of the work:\\n1.\\tA discussion of a Bayesian EEG analysis as an alternative to frequentist methods\\n2.\\tAn attempt to explicitly model item and participant effects\\n3.\\tA nuanced discussion of Bayesian priors required to model inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) effects\\n\\nQuestions and clarifications:\\n1.\\tThe authors pitch the need to model item and participant effects as the main incentive for switching to Bayesian analysis. However, there is a frequentist approach that achieves the same effect — mixed effects modeling. Mixed effects models have been gaining popularity for EEG analyses, including analyses of ITPC (see e.g. Koerner & Zhang, 2017). Of course, this doesn’t mean that the Bayesian analysis has no value, but I would recommend the authors to adjust their motivating arguments (and possibly mention mixed effects models as a frequentist alternative)\\n2.\\tDifferential effects across electrodes/participants. The authors correctly state that averaging the data across electrodes and participants “washes out” effects of interest that vary across them. However, their analysis doesn’t quite seem to address this issue: the effect of condition is modeled to be the same across all electrodes and participants if I understand it correctly. Thus, while modeling the variance in participant-, electrode-, and condition-specific averages is certainly a step forward, differential effects across participants and electrodes remain unaccounted for in this model.\\n3.\\tHow much data are required for the proposed analysis? It might be helpful to have a brief discussion of guidelines for determining whether the number of, e.g., item repetitions across participants is sufficient to fit the model. \\n4.\\tIn eqs. 7 and 8, does alpha without a subscript correspond to the baseline value shared across participants, electrodes and conditions? The current wording is a bit ambiguous on that point.\\n5.\\tThe justification for using the log-logistic link function to model gamma is unclear to me (an outsider to this subfield). We don’t need to know the specifics but a one-line explanation or a reference would help.\\n\\n\\nMinor:\\n-\\tTo better advertise the analysis for scientists used to frequentist methods, it might be useful to include Bayesian factor as a more direct alternative to frequentist hypothesis testing\\n-\\tIn Figure 3, you might want to highlight the key conditions of interest\\n\\nOverall, this is an interesting contribution to the field of EEG data analysis, with clear applications in the domain of neurolinguistics.\\n',\n",

The work sits at the intersection of tier-based analyses of phonotactic computational complexity (Heinz et al) and artifical grammar learning (AGL) experiments on learning of local and nonlocal phonological processes. The submission is as an extended abstract.\\n\\nThe authors provide pseudocode for the functioning of the model, walk the reader through an example of its functioning on some data, and discuss its relevance to human performance on previous AGL experiments. They also compare the model\\'s performance against those of competing HMM and FSM based models.\\n\\nThe authors make a number of claims that require non-trivial support e.g. (i) that learning non-local is harder than local, which may be true in AGL scenarios but this says little or nothing about natural language acquisition scenarios, or (ii) claims from model learning results that human learners construct tiers.\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of unclarity in the formalism and notation: it feels like much of this could have been eliminated from this submission but would benefit a subsequent lengthier submission where there is more room for definitions and examples.\\n\\nSome specific notes:\\n- opening discussion of English plural morph refers to it as a phonological segment (omitting discussion of the [-Id] realization)\\n- the composition of V should be clarified in line 94 (i.e. input-output pairs of what; this is unclear from context)\\n- if segments are treated as bundles of features (line 117) then it\\'s not clear why segments continue to be referred to\\n- it\\'s not clear how the final tier is written back to the final output form; the tier projection operation as described seems to be lossy (the \"final sequence\" in lines 135-137 appears to only be the final tier representation)\\n- the input V (set of input-output pairs) to Algorithm 1 appears to not be used/referenced anywhere in the algorithm\\n- the notion of \"accuracy\" referenced on line 148 and in Algorithm 1 is not clear; accuracy at what?\\n- the work is reminiscent of the search/copy approach (Samuels, Nevins, Reiss/Mailhot) to phonological operations (including the observation that strict locality is merely a special case of non-locality), only with unnecessary notational baggage and it\\'s not clear what it\\'s benefit is\\n\\nNotwithstanding all of the above, the paper is a promising start to work that could eventually make contact with the tier-based formal work from the Stony Brook group providing some linking hypotheses across Marrian levels of phonology.

       "     'review': 'The article presents a computational model for dealing with phonological alternations. It presents a cognitive argument for why this is interesting, but could also use a computational argument for why this is interesting, i.e., how might this model be used? Overall it is very well written and easy to understand. The only problems I had with the article were about formatting:\\n\\n1. Place Figures and Tables below the paragraphs that you first mention them in. For instance, Figure 1 is on the first page but not mentioned until the second, while Table 2 is before the paragraph starting on line 271.\\n2. As far as I know (although if I\\'m wrong please ignore this), the symbol, \"§\", is not required of you to use. I was quite confused about what it was supposed to mean and you don\\'t use it consistently. For a while I thought you were trying to use a symbol for the word \\'Figure\\'. After clicking on it I grasped that you\\'re using it to mark the presence of a footnote, but then later you also use it to denote a section in the main text. \\nIn terms of footnotes, seeing as the citations are spelled out, i.e., not superscripted, there\\'s no reason to use a confusing symbol that takes up space. I recommend you use superscripts for footnotes and delete the \"§\" (as you did on line 267). That\\'s my first opinion. My second opinion is that you can do without footnotes entirely. You don\\'t say anything that can\\'t be added to the main text or left out. For instance, footnote 1 is there just to tell you that in 3.1.1 there is more info... You don\\'t need a footnote for that. I would even say that footnote 2 is something that should be in the main text as its an important detail. \\nIn terms of using the \"§\" symbol to denote sections in the main text... I suppose the question would be \"why?\" Does it facilitate reading? On line 153, does it make reading easier to tell the reader they can find out more in the section that immediately follows? My first opinion is that you get rid of these as I don\\'t understand what purpose they serve. My second opinion is that if you really want to keep them then you need to follow writing logic and put them in parentheticals because they do not belong within the syntax of the sentences you are placing them in. You did this correctly on line 211.\\n\\nBelow are some minor writing mistakes\\n1. line 028: \\'phonological environments\\'\\n2. line 072: \\'a phonological tier is a representation\\', or \\'phonological tiers are representations\\'\\n3. line 102: \\'process\\'\\n4. line 112, \\'a local rule, 𝑟adj, applied\\'\\n5. line 228: \\'the one that scored higher\\'\\n6. line 239: \\'over the non-harmonizing choice\\'\\n7. line 246 and 247: \\'and consequently could not generalize from the training data to test instances even when humans did\\'\\n8. line 258: \\'All vowels that participate\\'\\n9. line 273 and 274: \\'consisting of 200 training words and 800 novel words\\'\\n10. line 275: \\'D2L learned\\'',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper describes a simulation study in learning to predict tense from CDS sentences from the Adam corpus. The model uses auxiliaries and the past suffix -ed to detect tense, but does not learn morphologically irregular past tenses nor the periphrastic future \"going to\". These effects are linked to trends in input frequency as well as analyses from the human learning literature.\\n\\nI found the paper very interesting in its focus on language acquisition of an important semantic distinction and in linking explicitly to work on human learning. I also appreciated the use of nonce verbs and various probing techniques in analyzing the reuslts.\\n\\nI did have some problems in following the argumentation.\\n\\n1: Line 63 says \"the other hypothesis is that temporal adverbs could facilitate\" the learning of tense. But I don\\'t see where this hypothesis comes from. The cited research on the following lines suggests that children don\\'t pay much attention to temporal adverbs. So whose hypothesis is this and why is it worth studying?\\n\\n2: I am a bit confused about the model setup. My understanding is that the model is a 2-layer transformer without any pretraining (section 4.1) and that only the tokenizers are adopted from pretrained LMs (section 4.2). Table 2 shows the training data sizes of three models, Roberta, BabyBerta and 2y/o BabyBerta and also their number of parameters (which should be irrelevant if no pretraining is used). I think these pretrained models are used only to create the tokenizers, not the model itself. However, I am not perfectly clear on this point, especially because later tables 3 and 5 report performance by \"Model\" ranging across Roberta, BabyBerta and 2y/o. \\n\\n3: Following from this, if no pretraining is used, I am not sure why this decision was made. Pretraining followed by fine-tuning is known to learn more robust semantic representations than just learning to classify and would potentially do a better job of extracting the lexical semantics of irregular verbs based on their distribution. Why train a new transformer from scratch instead of using BabyBerta itself as a model and adding a classifier layer on top of it?\\n\\n4: Although the three tokenizers are compared throughout, there is no clear conclusion about the differences between them; I am not sure in the end why this comparison is important.',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper asks whether linguistic input alone (i.e., without situational context) is sufficient for acquiring English tense. They hypothesize that it is, and test with three related transformer models, RoBERTa, which uses BPE to capture sub-word information, BabyBERTa, which is trained on English CHILDES, and a 2yo-BabyBERTa trained on a fraction of CHILDES. They conclude that there results support the hypothesis.\\n\\nI like that the authors trained on CHILDES and used BabyBERTa. The recognize that RoBERTa, which trained on orders of magnitude more data than a learner would receive by age 2-3 may overachieve for that reason. 2yo-BabyBERTa seems unecessary to me. BabyBERTa was trained on 5M words, but that\\'s just a large fraction of what an individual learner would hear. It seems unnecessary to restrict it further.\\n\\nI\\'m worried about the posibility of test-on-train here. Isn\\'t 5M words pretty much all of English CHILDES? Can the authors be sure that BabyBERTa (or even RoBERTa? I don\\'t know) weren\\'t trained on the subset of CHILDES that they\\'re testing on?\\n\\nThe authors report results on a held out (but see above) test set and a set of sentences with nonce verbs.

However, they could\\'ve come to the opposite conclusion based on the nonce study. A contrarian could easily conclude language alone is insufficient.\\n\\nSecond, and I think more profoundly, is that there\\'s no particular reason to believe that transformers are good models of human learning. The authors rightly acknowledge this: \"Although the transformer models do not represent children’s acquisition mechanisms, we hope this study could provide some insight in understanding the acquisition process of tense.\"\\n\\nSo we can\\'t conclude anything about acquisition from this study, other than, perhaps, that training on a big chunk of CHILDES works almost as well as training on 30B tokens of miscellaneous text for this purpose.',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper proposes a cue-based retrieval model for a really interesting pronoun resolution phenomenon in German: The distinction in reference preferences between personal vs. demonstrative pronouns, depending on different aspects contributing to a referent’s saliency. Contributing factors to a referent’s saliency that are considered include subjecthood, agenthood and order of mention, which are fleshed out in terms of (weighted) cue prominence in the new models proposed. The authors show that a model with these additional weighted prominence cues is able to account for key empirical patterns in human data found by Schumacher et al. (2006), as defined in Effects 1-3 in the paper.\\n\\n**General**\\n\\nThe paper is well-written and provides a great overview of the phenomenon of interest and motivation for the modeling work that is its main contribution. The models seem (mostly) straightforward; however, key information about the model and evaluation methodology and are omitted, which leave the conclusions the authors want to draw unwarranted (for now).\\n\\n**Specific questions/Comments**\\n\\n* A key component missing in the paper is a well-defined model evaluation metric. For example, looking at Table 2, we see that Models 2 & 3a severely overestimate condition a., underestimate b., and are about in the right ballpark for conditions c. & d. Yet, Model 3a is claimed to capture the relevant variance in the human data. What are the variances for the conditions in the human data? What is the variance in the model results? Do they align? The way it reads now is a qualitative comparison of proportions where an Effect is captured if the target referent is chosen more than 50% of the times, disregarding differences in preferences between conditions in the human data, which seems unsatisfactory.\\n* Relatedly, is there a particular reason why there is no effect described that relates to the AA-NC condition? The baseline model seems to be closest, quantitatively & qualitatively speaking, to the human data here, whereas both other models underestimate the proportion. So *is* the baseline model capturing some crucial variance in the data that the other models are not?\\n\\n* Again relatedly, is a unanimous preference for the second referent expected for the baseline model given that the retrieval cues are always consistent with both referents (provided I understand this correctly)? Shouldn’t the model perform at chance? Clarifying the model description and training regime would be helpful for this I believe.\\n* “In the modified model we weighted the retrieval cue of thematic role 1.5 times higher than other cues used to retrieve the antecedent”. Is it true that the thematic role cue is weighted 1.5 times higher than the baseline model cues as well, or only higher than other prominence-inducing cues (grammatical role/ order of mention)? The former seems counter-intuitive as grammatical features should provide a stronger bias for pronoun resolution than thematic roles. If my interpretation is correct, it would be good to add empirical evidence for this effect, as I don’t think this is concluded by Schumacher et al. (2016), which is their reference.\\n\\n**Thoughts regarding future extensions to the modeling work (do not need to be included in the paper!)**\\n\\n* As it stands the paper assumes a complementary distribution between personal pronouns *er/sie/es* and demonstrative pronouns *der/die/das*. I wonder how other demonstrative pronouns like *dieser, jener, derjenige* will figure into this constellation?\\n* Furthermore, given the way in which the models for PPros and DPros are set up, I wonder how this approach will extend to contexts in which there are more than two referents in the context? (cf. Patterson & Schumacher 2021)\\n\\n**Minor**\\n\\n* For reader orientation, it would be good to spell out the critical effects in terms of predictions that clearly relate to the human data in Table 2. I.e., Effect 1: P(first referent|AA-CA, PPro) > P(second referent|AA-CA, PPro)\\n\\nOverall, this paper takes a cool approach to modeling an interesting phenomenon, but given the lack of detail in the model description and evaluation, the conclusions it draws do not seem sufficiently supported.',\n",

       "     'review': '\\nThe paper describes an approach to model personal and demonstrating pronoun resolution using the ACT-R cue-based theory. The authors compare the baseline model with 3 models that differ in terms of use of prominence features (thematic role, grammatical role, order of mention) as retrieval cues and weights assigned to these cues. The results show that the models with weighted cues perform best in capturing pronoun resolution patterns found in the human data. The model for the personal pronoun resolution captures all the 3 effects, while the model for the demonstrative pronoun resolution captures 2 out of 3 effects. The weighted cues model outperforms the baseline and prominence (but no weights) models.\\n\\nI found the paper to be well motivated as well as well written. However one key issue with the paper is that the claims are unsubstantiated, i.e., not enough details are provided regarding the methodology and evaluation. For example, we don\\'t know if the difference in percentages found in the human data significantly different? Similarly, the authors claim that the models 2 and 3a/3b are able to capture various effects, e.g., \"The model captured Effect-1 and Effect-2 for the PPro: ...\" what is the basis of saying this? Is it based on the fact that the differences in the percentages found in the human data and the models are qualitatively similar or was there some objective way of testing this similarity? On similar lines, the authors state that \"Model predictions are generated by running 10000 simulations for each model\" and \"The antecedent preferences of the model are determined by calculating proportions of referents retrieved across all simulations\". This evaluation criterion is not backed by a rationale, for example, to make the prediction of the model more comparable with the experiment, shouldn\\'t the model be evaluated on the same number of items that the humans were exposed to? and then to take correct proportion of PPro/DPro from them? \\n\\nIn sum, this is a good work, but I am unable to evaluate it with confidence given the lack of information regarding some critical issues related to methodology and evaluation.\\n\\n',\n",

       "     'review': 'There\\'s something potentially of interest here but this version of the paper feels very disjointed. It is hard to identify the key thread of ideas that the authors intend to be the main take-home message, and it is hard to understand the logical links between various sections of the paper.\\n\\nPerhaps the key concrete point that I can identify is that classifiers tend to change from narrowly-applicable to more general over historical time, and the model presented in section 4 correctly recreates this effect. This is the most meaningful common thread I can find running through the paper. The empirical point about the historical change is buried in the middle of section 2 (lines 174-183) in amongst discussion of all sorts of other things, and the fact that the simulations recreate this pattern is mentioned (lines 468-473) as one of three findings in section 4.2. (Even this would be clearer if the authors explicitly mentioned that more features means more specific. And at line 460, it should be stated explicitly that the graphs show the average number of features *per classifier*.) In between, there\\'s very little to help the reader connect the dots: for example, the intro to section 4 says nothing about what kind of patterns the authors are hoping to recreate (only that they will \"investigate the dynamics of classifier systems over time\").\\n\\nThe logic of the relationship between section 3 and section 4 seems muddled. In section 3 itself, the corpus study is presented as evidence *against* the non-neutral, ambiguity-avoidance hypothesis, and this is presented as justification for adopting a model without functional pressures in section 4. But the abstract, for example, says that \"acquisition without reference to ambiguity avoidance is *sufficient* to drive broad trends\", which makes it sound like the paper will be treating the neutral hypothesis as the simpler/null hypothesis and showing that additional assumptions (i.e. non-neutrality) are unnecessary. So there\\'s a confusing inconsistency in the way the authors talk about which hypothesis (neutral or non-neutral) is the one that makes \"additional assumptions\".\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of material in section 2 which seems to be irrelevant: differences between classifiers and noun classes, age at which children exhibit competent use, semantic vs. arbitrary. All of this leaves the reader thinking that maybe some of these empirical facts will be things that the authors end up offering an explanation for, but as far as I can tell most of it plays no role. This includes the fact that the timecourse of a single child\\'s acquisition demonstrates a move towards over-use of general classifiers; I don\\'t understand how the simulations have any connection to that. (I\\'m still confused after lines 532-536.)\\n\\nIn section 3, I think I understand the important take-home message of the corpus study itself, but the presentation is somewhat confusing at times.\\n\\t- The logic at lines 244-248 seems slightly wrong. The preceding paragraph already established a candidate cause of greater homophony in Mandarin than Cantonese. Given this, if it\\'s *also* true that homophony avoidance drives change, then we\\'d expect more classifier disambiguation in Mandarin than in Cantonese. The phrasing in the paper seems to suggest that the homophony avoidance hypothesis plays a part in predicting the increased ambiguity in Mandarin.\\n\\t- As far as I can tell, the terms \"homophony\" and \"ambiguity\" are used more or less interchangeably. This isn\\'t necessarily incorrect, but the logic could be clearer if the authors stuck to just one term.\\n\\t- Similarly, the phrase \"homophony avoidance\" is somewhat confusing. As defined by the authors (line 266), the degree of homophony is just determined by the particular collection of form-transcription pairs that occur in the corpus. (It might also help to note that the transcription effectively determines the pronunciation.) So there\\'s no way for classifier usage to \"avoid\" homophony. So something like \"homophony mitigation\" or \"homophony circumvention\" would be better than \"homophony avoidance\". (Perhaps the authors intended to distinguish between *homophony* and *ambiguity avoidance*, which would make sense, but the usage doesn\\'t seem to be consistently in line with that.)\\n\\t- It might help to mention that matching on types means matching on *character* types, not *transcription* types.\\n\\t- In Table 1, why is the number of types for Mandarin_type not exactly 1182?\\n\\nIt\\'s (mostly) unclear what the authors really want the reader to take away from the presentation of the results in section 4. They mention three findings (lines 456), but only one is clear the me: the one about moving towards generality, in the paragraph beginning at line 464. The second finding is something about the fact that the simulations tend to reach steady states (476-488), but I can\\'t find any mention of what empirical point this is intended to align with. The last paragraph (489-501) seems to be framed as the third finding, but again this just seems to be a report of how certain simulations turned out, rather than an identifiable trend that meaningful aligns with an empirical target. A few lines later this is all just summarized as \"provides insight into the long-term dynamics of classifier systems\" (507), but the authors don\\'t even seem to be trying to express what that insight is.\\n\\nThe opposition between \"input\" and \"functional factors\" (line 219) seems like a category error to me. Certainly there is always a tension between the input and generalization in any form of learning; but then the question of what role functional factors play is a question about the nature of the generalization that occurs, not the balance between input and generalization. I had a similar reaction around lines 506: would a proponent of functional pressures say that their account is not \"acquisition-driven\"? The idea that acquisition drives change (which is virtually a truism) seems orthogonal to the question about functional pressures.',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper shows two sets of experiments in an attempt to explicitly model change in classifier systems as some outcome of child language acquisition. The topic is interesting, and the paper includes several interesting ideas, and has great suggestions about future work. However, there are some parts that are not clear to me. While it assumes that language acquisition may drive trends in classifier patterns over time, what the changes are have not been clearly defined. For example, in the introduction, the authors mentioned the replacement of the general classifier \\'mei\\' with the currently more dominantly-used \\'ge\\' over time; while this indeed is an interesting point of inquiry, the studies presented in the paper were not able to address this type of change. Alos, is adults\\' using more specific classifiers while dropping the general classifiers considered \"a change\"? If yes, this point should be elaborated. The authors mentioned that such selections may be related to discourses, or due to sociolinguistic factors, but the experiment results only show that children tend to acquire the (old or new) uses of classifiers presented by adults, and then stabilize the use of them, and therefore although I agree with the authors that the results support the trends of learning and neutral processes, they do not seem to be related to language change. \\n\\nBelow are some minor suggestions about the organization and the contents. \\n1. Introduction: Need to reconsider what role the example of \\'mei\\'-\\'ge\\' plays in the paper.\\n2. Section 2 can directly highlight how similar classifier systems and inflectional agreement systems are in terms of modeling, and then elaborate how the classifier system can be modeled. Currently, the first half of the section suggests the otherwise (i.e., they are very different grammatical properties).\\n3. The differences between classifiers and measure words do not seem to be relevant to the current study. Maybe using classifiers as a cover term would be enough.\\n4. Mandarin \\'ge\\' although is a general classifier, it functions as an individualizer (i.e., its function is to pick out one individual entity in particular); the description of it at the beginning of the paper is a bit misleading.

       "     'review': 'This paper reports an investigation of how neural language models can be used to judge a candidate\\'s \"hireability\" and other traits from transcripts of job interviews and writing samples (E1) and prosodic information (E2). They find that embeddings derived from linguistic information alone can outperform the feature-engineered baseline model from previous work which included features for prosody, eye movements, etc. Adding prosodic features results in some performance improvement, but not for the model which already had the highest correlation with human ratings on its own (word2vec).\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nThis is an interesting set of studies, however, I\\'m not sure that CMCL is the best venue for it. The primary take-away seems to be that neural language models could be used to aid in the process of evaluating candidates, but it\\'s not at all clear what the cognitive/linguistic implications are. If the goal is primarily application, the authors should discuss the important limitations of using these kinds of algorithms to make decisions that impact people\\'s lives, given the well-known biases that they tend to reflect. If the goal is to draw some conclusions about cognition, the link needs to be made much more clear in the framing. \\n\\n\\nMINOR \\n\\nThe main conclusion suggests that NLMs can be useful for candidate trait evaluation but in fact the evidence presented here only shows that the 4 models highlighted in the main text provide any advantage. It\\'s unclear how many of the model variants actually outperform the baseline. It appears that only a few best-performing ones are statistically compared to the baseline, so the conclusion becomes even more narrow. Again, this would be fine if the goals are about engineering a model that predicts well but unclear what to make of this in terms of cognitive interpretations.\\n\\nIt seems like the choice to only use prosody in addition to embeddings could be better motivated. I am not familiar with the original work (Naim et al., 2018) but it seems like the lack of performance improvement due to facial features in those models doesn\\'t preclude that they could explain meaningful variance in the current models, when paired with a different set of predictors.\\n',\n",

They compare against a baseline model using hand-crafted features and show that neural representations (static e.g. word2vec and contextual i.e. BERT, also augmented with prosodic information) significantly outperform the baseline. It's somewhat surprising to see this submitted to CMCL, as there is no clear cognitive modeling component to the paper.\\n\\nIt is interesting and unexpected (to this reader) that simple word2vec representations were effectively the best performing representations.

Technology like this has a very real potential to be misused, but more concerningly often proves discriminatory even when used without nefarious intent.

       "     'review': 'This paper describes text-based systems for predicting various qualities related to job interview performance. Systems using word2vec and BERT can outperform traditional feature-based classifiers using small feature sets like LIWC and some basic computer vision applied to interview video. Some scores (including whether the interview candidate smiled) are actually better predicted from text than video. Where differences between w2v and BERT exist, w2v is generally better; the gap can potentially be closed by using prosody.\\n\\nThe work\\'s main strengths are the somewhat surprising fact that some non-textual scores can be predicted from text and the significant improvement over previous work.\\n\\nI see two main weaknesses: fit with CMCL and misgivings about the paper\\'s impact.\\n\\nWith regard to fit, there is relatively little in this paper that seems cognitive or psychological. The most significant psychological point made is that \"when not enough linguistic cues are available at the lexical-semantic level, additional extra-linguistic materials are required to successfully process the information provided\", but the argument for this is that prosody improves the weaker BERT classifier more than the strong w2v classifier. Adding extra features generally improves weak classifiers more than strong ones. Moreover, the analysis in the paper does not single out instances where \"not enough linguistic cues are provided\", but rather ones where the classifier is not making good use of the cues it already has. (As an additional point, failure to find significance should not be considered as an indicator that the effect does not exist, particularly when the models have different variances--- lines 237-244.)\\n\\nWith regard to impact, automated systems for hiring are an ethical minefield (with Amazon\\'s famously sexist hiring tool frequently cited as an example of what not to do). This paper does not consider potential ethical issues resulting from real-world deployment of this technology. Some things that would have to be considered are: the paper makes predictions about qualities such as smiling and speech rate from text which *must be* purely correlational. Such indicators cannot be reported to a decision-maker without explaining that they are imputed without reference to the actual phenomena they claim to be measuring. The paper does not evaluate bias on the basis of demographic characteristics in the classifier output. The current system outperforms the baseline on most of the individual personality factors but not on overall hireability, leading to questions about the validity of this judgment in the first place. While these questions are probably beyond the scope of this work, the paper should include a clear statement that this system cannot be deployed for any practical purpose and a citation to the ethics literature to explain why.',\n",

       "    'content': {'title': 'The rediscovery of syntactic structure',\n",
       "     'review': 'This paper puts forward what I imagine is intended as a novel model of syntactic structure for natural language, which allows uniformities across languages to be straightforwardly characterized via a single underlying (declarative) structure. The paper then goes on to argue that this model could be used as the basis for an MT system. \\n\\nMuch as I am sympathetic to the importance of abstract structure in characterizing natural language syntax and in deriving underlying meaning, the current paper does not advance our state of understanding of this area. The proposed theory comes across as a rehashing of existing ideas that have popped up repeatedly in the history of grammatical description. The synapper structures for noun phrases look very much like dependency trees. The proposal for interrogatives in section 4.3 recalls Zelig Harris\\'s idea that non-canonical sentence types need to be transformed into a \"normal form\".  The idea that structures can exhibit ambiguity goes back to Chomsky\\'s earlier arguments (in \"Syntactic Structures\"). And the proposal that syntactic structure should allow recursive embedding has a similarly long history.  The one novel contribution concerns the cyclic character of word order patterns, and the division into clockwise and counter-clockwise languages. This is a novel idea, so far as I am aware (though one could imagine deriving this distinction from the approach to word order explored by R. Kayne in his \"Antisymmetry of Syntax\" book). This idea would be more compelling if it could be shown that the distinction between these two classes of languages correlated with some other property. Otherwise, it comes across as merely taxonomic. \\n\\nThe paper\\'s discussion of MT is even weaker. After a detailed recounting of the performance of existing systems on the translation of a single Korean sentence into English, the paper puts forward what would be the translation of the same sentence derived from the current approach. The problem is, as far as I can tell, there is no implemented system. And in carrying out this translation, the paper permits arbitrary changes to be made in service of producing the translation (e.g. lines 596-600). Saying what the answer *would* be if such a system existed will not be convincing at all to readers with any appreciation of the complexity of building MT systems. While I don\\'t think that NLP progress should be held hostage to performance on benchmark datasets, as incremental advances won\\'t necessarily lead to fundamental progress, the bar for progress is higher than what is done here. \\n\\nFinally, the paper presents this structure-based approach to MT as though it is a novel contribution. However, the idea that translation should be done via a mapping between a cross-linguistically uniform underlying structure is a well-studied one, called either syntactic transfer or interlingua, depending on the abstraction of the analysis.  For more recent syntactic-transfer approaches, see the discussion in Williams, Sennrich, Post, and Koehn\\'s book on Syntax-Based Statistical Machine Translation. And it would be worth paying attention to the many well-studied cases of structural divergence, where the mapping from the structure of one language to the structure of another is far from isomorphism, since they will pose problems for the approach proposed in this paper. (For an old, but still useful discussion, see B. Dorr\\'s 1994 Computational Linguistics paper \"Machine Translation Divergences: A Formal Description and Proposed Solution\", but there\\'s lots of work since then on this topic.)  I should also point out that much of the debate on per-NN syntax-based MT models concerned how to best represent the mapping between languages so as to best accommodate the divergences that exist.',\n",

       "     'review': 'I like to believe I always try to write constructive reviews, but I have to say that reading this paper was a puzzling experience.\\nAs it is written, the paper lacks any depth in its relation to the vast variety of literatures the authors seems to want to connect to. \\nWhat is the paper about? Left to the introduction alone, one would first think it a critique of constituency-based approaches to syntactic structure. Then it seems to be about how purely syntactic approaches are unnecessary for the task of machine translation, then it becomes a critique of Probabilistic models (in general. Any model whose output is probabilistic is unfit for machine translation according to the authors).\\n\\nThe paper  introduces a representation of sentences in the forms of unlabelled, cyclic graphs: a curious chimera of constituency structure, dependency trees, and a hint to lexical-functional graphs --- that has none of the formal advantages of these existing approaches, while attempting to capture the same information. The authors claim this \"new\" representation is better for Machine Translation broadly defined, but there is no evidence of this from a quantitative nor qualitative perspective.\\n\\nContent issues aside, the paper is just not thematically fit for CMCL. To clarify, I do think that there are many different ways to do “computational modeling”, and that a purely formal approach can be plenty “computational”. However, there is no modeling in here in any possible interpretation of the term, nor there is a computational contribution beyond the trivial existence of graphs (in fact, this is stated explicitly in the abstract!), nor there is anything resembling a “cognitive” topic. \\n\\n\\n## Specific Comments\\n\\nLack of focus aside, the paper makes an astounding number of unsupported claims (basically, one per paragraph), which are at best trivial and often plainly wrong. I address some of the broader ones in what follows to exemplify how the paper is completely disconnected from current work in linguistics and computational linguistics.\\n\\n- The first part of the introduction seems to take issue with how constituency based approaches deal with the mapping between syntactic variation and semantic interpretation. While of course there are plenty of approaches that argue for a tighter relation between syntax and semantics, it is a strong claim that similarly interpreted sentences cross-linguistically should map to the same syntactic structure. Additionally, this shows a misunderstanding of what standard constituency approaches do --- that is exactly to give identical syntactic structures to the same grammatical relations across languages, modulo what the authors seem to care about most, *head directionality*. Even putting these two points aside, the issue of semantic representations across languages is one the paper never goes back to. In fact, the papers end up adopting a representation (in the form of cyclic undirected graphs) that has NO explicit encoding of basic grammatical dependencies.\\n\\n- On the same page, the authors go ahead to claim *No one has yet been able to demonstrate how such a process can take place 6almost instantaneously in the human brain.*\\n\\n    *Such a process* here being the process of establishing grammatical relations between words. Now, putting aside the decades of psycholinguistic work on parsing across a variety of syntactic frameworks that the authors seem to think not relevant, this is once again a point the paper never goes back to. Again, the “formalism ” adopted by the paper is then a form of cyclic graph  which the authors never bother to formally introduce. How are these graphs derived from sentences?\\n\\n- We then get to what seems to be the main focus on the contribution: an improved machine translation model. Apart from not defining the scope of the problem at all, there is no attempt to contextualize the contribution with respect to the existing literature in the subfield --- apart from a few random references to transformers models. In fact, given how focused the intro is on syntactic representations, it is puzzling how the paper completely ignores the vast literature on how syntactic information (be if from constituency or dependency trees or both) has been incorporate in MT approaches of different kind.\\n\\n- They also state that “probabilistic” approaches are problematic because they do not lead to a 100% accuracy — which I take to mean a 1-t-1 correspondence between two sentences in two different languages — which is of course a puzzling statement by itself given that contextual translation is never 1-to-1 even when done by human annotators.\\n\\n- The rest of the paper becomes even harder to follow. The method section presents a “decomposition” of sentences based on S, V, O elements, which basically reintroduces constituency/dependency structures, again sprinkled with a variety of unsubstantiated claims.\\n\\n    Crucially, their “model” is not, in fact, a model. There is no attempt to explain the properties of their representations, how the system is supposed to work theoretically, how it would handle things like modifiers alternation, and within language word order variation. The authors seem to believe this \"multidimensional\" approach to be somehow simpler that constituency/dependency trees, while of course formally it is far from being simple (and putting aside the fact that hierarchical representations are trivially multidimensional).\\n\\n- There is also a puzzling section about “ambiguity” which is not about ambiguity at all. Their non-ambiguous examples aside, the authors quickly claim that lexical ambiguity can be dealt with within their “framework” (I use the term loosely) but do not even mention crucial cases of syntactic ambiguity?\\n\\n- Additionally, it was truly unclear to me how to interpret the “Comparison of MT Models” section, as there is no comparison (unless we think extrapolating one paragraph from Google Translate counts as a comparison). Reading this section made it seem like the authors believe that translating a sentence can truly be reduced to the task of one to one translation of words (dismissed as an easy trick itself) and picking a point to start from in their graph.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The paper first recalls the main aspects of the LC parsing technique and provides  examples. This first part is very pedagogical, but could be reduced and leave place for the core of the paper. The paper then describes the experiment by presenting first what authors call the environment setup. The idea consists in extracting from the PTB several trees and analyze the behavior of a parser. At each step, depending on the action selected by the parser, a penalty is associated with the state. The experiment itself consists in studying the behavior of 15 reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to a subset of trees chosen for their simplified structures (reduced depth, all starting with an NP-subject). A description of the main characteristics of each RL technique is given, and a  summary of the results with a short discussion is proposed. \\n\\nThe paper presents an interesting and important idea, proposing a method and some results in the perspective of arguing in favor of a cognitive ground for RL algorithms. However, it suffers from several drawback. First, the method for selecting the penalty is not well motivated, and looks arbitrary. The same for the proposed evaluation metrics, that are very basic. But the main problem of the paper is that it fails at providing any evidence in favor of a cognitive motivation. There is no precise analysis of the core of  RL mechanisms that should be arguments in favor of that. The paper only gives a set of results, with no precise discussion and no conclusion. At this stage, even though the idea is interesting, it seems to me not elaborated enough to be presented at CMCL. ',\n",

       "     'review': 'To the Editors: I feel compelled to state that I had already reviewed this paper for a previous conference several months ago, and none of the issues found there have been addressed. Because of this, I can\\'t confidently believe the authors\\' would  take the reviews into account in a potential camera ready. The rest of my review is the same as my previous one, since nothing in the paper has been changed.\\n\\n## Big Picture Comments\\n\\nFrom one side, the paper is generally well-written and the technical results seem sound (it is not possible to replicate the results, since the authors do not share their code, but the technical set-up appears correct to me, independently of the specific numerical scores).\\nThe contribution is **potentially** interesting, but in ways that are made hard to evaluate given the paper.\\nUnfortunately, the main issue with this paper  its lack in clarity with respect to aims and overall conceptual contribution. In short: it is unclear what we are actually learning from the paper, and who the authors\\' think should be interested in their results (psycholinguists?computational linguists interested in symbolic models? neural network researchers? all of the above?). This is partially an artifact of significant presentation issues. I hope my comments below might help the authors\\' clarify the goals of the paper and its contribution to the broader literature.\\n\\n## Specific Comments\\n\\nOne issue in presentation is, in my opinion, the focus of the first half of the paper given the audience. The authors spend almost half of the paper motivating constituency parsing, and walking us through an example of the shift/predict/scan operations. This to me seems quite trivial, and if the purpose is to exemplify the rewards, that\\'s anyway made clearer in the later section.\\nHowever, what is missing is the motivation behind why applying a RL approach to this problem is valuable, and a walkthrough of RL fundamental intuitions, which seems to me way more needed given the scope of the paper than the scan/predict example.\\n\\nI know it seems I am being picky about form, but the reason is that this lack of motivations makes the rest of the paper relatively weak.\\nIt seems like the whole contribution is to substitute the classical control structure of these kind of parsing algorithms with a RL agent. Which, fine, but what is the advantage?\\nThe authors seem to be implying that the contribution is showing that the economy heuristic guiding the agents is learned from experience, but that just doesn\\'t seem to be true in any relevant sense. The fact that shortest parsing paths are preferred is baked into the reward structure, both at the local choice level and in terms of total reward, which explicitly penalized longer paths. So ok, this is less explicit than an oracle considering number of actions explicitly, but I would not say it \"derives\" from experience.\\n\\nIn turn, this leads the experimental section to land quite flatly. The authors claim implementing these kind of algorithms is challenging for RL. But so what is the contribution meant to be? In the introduction it seemed that the authors were arguing for advantages coming from applying RL to this parsing \"problem\". But then towards the end it seems that the contribution is in highlighting the limits of RL?\\nI am not saying these are not interesting results per se, they could be, but the authors never state why they should.\\n\\nIn short,  I think the conceptual foundation is missing from the paper, and thus the reader is left wondering. In this sense, the paper could benefit from a conclusion/summary section moving back from the particular results of the last section to the broader contribution. Clarifying what the authors think the aim of their approach is.\\n\\n\\nSome minor notes:\\n\\n- The authors put a lot of emphasis on the parsers being \"cognitively plausible\", and I think they mean two things: (a) the eargerness of the left corner strategy (cue Resnik) and (b) the shortest path (parsing step counting) heuristic. Is that correct? I have no problems with either, in principle. But I don\\'t think the prominence of either in the actual suggested contribution justifies having \"cognitively plausible\" in the title. The referenced literature seems to be lacking in this sense, missing a lot of work on connecting symbolic parsing algorithms to sentence processing behavior (boston2008parsing,chen2021quantifying,stanojevic2021modeling) Also note that there is a variety of ways (depending on what kind of cognitive, representational commitments one entails) in which these kind of minimal-steps ideas can be understood.\\n\\n- In the abstract and through, the authors mention evaluating the\"psycholinguistic implications\" of RL algorithms, but there is barely a mention of that towards the end (that is left uninterpretable given the content of the paper). It is also left unclear how actually plausible these algorithms are, since the tree depth and things like adjunction seem to matter in ways that clearly do not for the human parser (sturt2005processing). In fact, we are even left wondering what the \"cognitively plausible\" mentioned in the title refers to.\\n\\n## Some References\\n\\n@article{boston2008parsing,\\ntitle={Parsing costs as predictors of reading difficulty: An evaluation using the Potsdam Sentence Corpus},\\nauthor={Boston, Marisa Ferrara and Hale, John and Kliegl, Reinhold and Patil, Umesh and Vasishth, Shravan},\\njournal={Journal of Eye Movement Research},\\nvolume={2},\\nnumber={1},\\nyear={2008}\\n}\\n\\n@article{chen2021quantifying,\\ntitle={Quantifying Structural and Non-structural Expectations in Relative Clause Processing},\\nauthor={Chen, Zhong and Hale, John T},\\njournal={Cognitive Science},\\nvolume={45},\\nnumber={1},\\npages={e12927},\\nyear={2021},\\npublisher={Wiley Online Library}\\n}\\n\\n@inproceedings{kobele2013memory,\\ntitle={Memory resource allocation in top-down minimalist parsing},\\nauthor={Kobele, Gregory M and Gerth, Sabrina and Hale, John},\\nbooktitle={Formal grammar},\\npages={32--51},\\nyear={2013},\\norganization={Springer}\\n}\\n\\n\\n@inproceedings{stanojevic2021modeling,\\ntitle={Modeling incremental language comprehension in the brain with Combinatory Categorial Grammar},\\nauthor={Stanojevi{\\\\\\'c}, Milo{\\\\v{s}} and Bhattasali, Shohini and Dunagan, Donald and Campanelli, Luca and Steedman, Mark and Brennan, Jonathan and Hale, John},\\nbooktitle={Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics},\\npages={23--38},\\nyear={2021}\\n}\\n\\n@article{sturt2005processing,\\ntitle={Processing coordinated structures: Incrementality and connectedness},\\nauthor={Sturt, Patrick and Lombardo, Vincenzo},\\njournal={Cognitive Science},\\nvolume={29},\\nnumber={2},\\npages={291--305},\\nyear={2005},\\npublisher={Wiley Online Library}\\n}',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper addresses the phenomenon of human comprehenders frequently misassign thematic roles to arguments in ways that seem to be driven by \"processing heuristics based on their expectations about events ... rather than relying on syntactic rules\". For example, participants frequently misinterpret \\'The dog was bitten by the man\\' as having the man as the patient and the dog as the agent. The authors train a neural network model to construct a representation of a sentence which captures information about the assignment of thematic roles to arguments. They find that, in line with what has been observed in humans, the model\\'s accuracy in assigning roles is lowest for passive, semantically-anomalous sentences like \\'The dog was bitten by the man\\', and highest for active, non-anomalous sentences like \\'The dog bit the man\\'.\\n\\nThis would be somewhat interesting if the only empirical facts at hand were the facts about misinterpretations that the authors review in the introduction. (There would be the usual questions about the interpretability of the neural model, but there would at least be something to talk about.) But the whole interest of the Ferreira-style findings is the fact that those interpretations are *mis*interpretations -- when we say that they are *mis*interpretations, we don\\'t mean that they diverge from what the stodgy old syntax textbooks say, we mean that they diverge from what those same human comprehenders will tell you if you give them a couple of extra seconds to think about it. That\\'s the other fact at hand which the authors seem to completely disregard (and that\\'s why the stodgy old syntax textbooks say what they say). The whole interest, in other words, is what sort of mind would exhibit this divergence between interpretations at two different timescales. The model described in the paper does not exhibit any such divergence, it only captures one half of the picture.',\n",

While Bever\\'s own proposal includes a 2nd route that is influenced by grammar, this submission only focuses on the first route. The paper exhibits a model that faithfully misperceives Patients as Agents when they are more plausible in that semantic role.\\n\\nIn the writing, I sense a suggestion that somehow modeling this phenomenon bolsters the view that syntax is unnecessary (e.g. \"pose a challenge to classic linguistic theories and models\" page 4). This is not true. This view, while perennially-appealing to syntax-haters around the world, is simply not supported by Ferriera\\'s results, Kuperberg\\'s or by this paper\\'s modeling. Rather what I think this paper shows is that recurrent neural networks can faithfully implement what David Caplan (MIT Press 1992) has called the \"heuristic route\" -- I take this to be roughly the same as Bever\\'s syntax-free Perceptual Strategies from the 1970s.\\n\\nIf this submission\\'s rhetoric were recalibrated to say for example \"this is a model of what people with Broca\\'s Aphasia can do\" it could make a valuable contribution by deriving predictions about new cases where plausibility might override structure. Another improvement would be to characterize the contribution of the gated units (i.e LSTM) as compared to Doug Rohde\\'s thesis which used ungated, Elman style Simple Recurrent Nets.\\n\\nI am recommending reject because publication of this version would reflect badly on CMCL. As inclusive as we are at this workshop, scholarship is a non-negotiable requirement.

The theoretical contribution is to work out how these two model variants can be combined, and that seems quite appropriate for the current venue. Unfortunately, the empirical side is not yet well fleshed-out: the prior data are not described in any depth, and the evaluation is completely qualitative.

       "     'review': 'This paper presents a formal model — within the RSA framework — of pragmatic inferences about the frequency of an activity that arise when utterances contain information that is in principle redundant (under default assumptions for an event type). The authors first present a version of the model (hRSA) that incorporates prior expectations given common ground knowledge, building on Degen et al (2015).  This model fails to account for the possible preference of speakers to use more costly utterances to convey unusual meanings and the fact that these more costly utterances strengthen the inference. To remedy this, the authors proposed a modified version of the model (noisy hRSA), which takes into account the memorability of a given utterance form, building on Bergen and Goodman (2015).\\n\\nI have read the paper with interest, but do not think that it is suitable for CMCL. The paper makes theoretical predictions, which is a strength. However, the work in its current state is largely incomplete: \\n\\n- the model revolves around one single example (the one given in the introduction) and no details about data are given (e.g., the data collected by Kravtchenko & Demberg (2015) is not described; nothing is said about how many types of events were targeted in the experiments by Kravtchenko (2021) regarding habituality priors);\\n- most importantly, no empirical evidence is provided for assumption (c), i.e., the hypothesized speaker behaviour which the model captures has not been empirically validated and it’s not clear why this should hold; \\n- similarly, no evidence for the claim that “speakers are very reluctant to use exclamation marks or other markers even in this condition” (lines 304-306);\\n- the values in table 1 are made up (“intuitively plausible” with no empirical evidence and not substantiated by a well-defined theory);\\n\\nThe authors acknowledge these weaknesses at the end of the conclusions. Given these limitations, my assessment is that the paper does not currently contain enough substance and is not a good fit for this workshop in particular. \\n\\nOther comments: \\n\\n- The RSA framework is given for granted. The paper should include a brief description of its main components. Space is clearly not an issue. \\n\\n- The term “atypicality inferences” used in the title is never used in the paper, where instead the phenomenon studied is referred to as “habituality inferences”.\\n\\n- What does hRSA stand for? (Is it “habituality RSA?). This acronym is used in section 3.1 without spelling out what it stands for, and without a citation (in line 246, it appears that this is not a contribution of the present paper but rather a model introduced in previous work). \\n\\n- Lines 169 and 385: wrong citation format. \\n\\n- Consider shortening the abstract, using one single paragraph, which is the established scholarly practice in the field.

       "     'review': 'I\\'m not sure that the way the authors measured the habituality prior will really get accurate measurements. If we assume that paying the cashier logically follows from going shopping, then even asking the question of how often he pays the cashier may introduce the same sort of Q-implicatures that stating \"he paid the cashier\" does -- respondents might think \"why ask me that unless there is reason to suspect that he often doesn\\'t\"? Thus, these ratings might not be giving a baseline habituality level; they might just be showing the same inferences that the main experiment is showing.\\n\\nIt seems to me that many potential implicatures may become available in the sorts of utterances used here. \"John went shopping -- oh yeah, and he paid the cashier\" might implicate that he doesn\\'t usually pay, but it might implicate lots of other things as well, and it\\'s not even clear to me that \"John usually doesn\\'t pay\" is even the most likely implicature to arise (hence the rather small effect seen in the author\\'s previous studies -- even in the more marked conditions, there is still a plurality of participants thinking that John usually pays). It\\'s especially hard to know what implicature to recover here without any context (so it would be useful to see the full stories that were used in the study; if participants only see these utterances in a minimal context I suspect that their interpretations would be so all over the place there would be nothing interesting to model; the authors mention that these were put in story contexts but I don\\'t see the full texts anywhere). It seems like it\\'s easy for an interlocutor to notice that the utterance is weird (flouting the maxim of quantity, the Q-principle, or whatever we want to call it) and that the speaker intends to produce some implicature, but exactly what that implicature is is very underdetermined -- indeed this has been one of the core criticisms of Gricean pragmatics ever since it started. \\n\\nThe authors state near the beginning of the paper that there has been little research attention to pragmatic inferences that involve changing one\\'s beliefs about the common ground, but this doesn\\'t seem right. Quite a lot of theorizing in pragmatics and discourse analysis has assumed that communication is all about updating the common ground and mutual knowledge; e.g., contra stuff like Grice\\'s theory of non-natural meaning, some approaches argue that the whole point of communication is to get an interlocutor to introduce something new into their understanding of the common ground. (e.g. Discourse Representation Theory.) Some pragmatic phenomena, particularly presupposition and conventional implicature, have been explained with recourse to how they put things into the common ground (e.g. work by Stalnaker, Potts; for a summary of work from the very dawn of pragmatics see e.g. chapter 4.4 of Levinson 1983).',\n",

The authors investigate how predictions vary in canonical and non-canonical order of the same sentences from two different domains (poetry and newspapers). \\n\\nThe investigation is relevant, and the linguistic motivations are well defined. However, there are some substantial limits. \\nOn a theoretical side, the authors claim their work is part of the line of research where human word predictivity is compared and tested by the performance of DNNs in next-word-prediction tasks. If this is was the aim, authors should test their results with behavioral data. In my opinion, this is more of a study on the linguistic abilities of Transformer Models.\\n\\nMoreover, the dataset selected is too small to make strong claims about the results. While it is true that this allows a detailed error analysis, the setup is questionable; among all, sentences are not balanced between the two domains.\\n\\nThe critical aspect, however, is the computational implementation. The description of the experimental setup is too vague. \\nOn the one side, some decisions are not motivated (why do they choose the output of the first or projection layer and not other layers?), and the resources used are not clearly stated. For instance, the authors state they use BERT, but then they cite UmBERTo, which actually inherits from RoBERTa the base model architecture. On the other side, the way the evaluation is described is so obscure that it is hard to understand what was concretely done, yet making it hard to reproduce. For instance, it is unclear what they mean by 'We evaluate word co-occurrence frequencies by means of embeddings as the cosine value made available by BERT': the cosine is used as a measure to compute the similarity between two word-embeddings, but in the paper, I cannot find which are the two embeddings directly compared. The prediction technique should be given more details, specifically how the authors deal with cases when a word is split into subtokens by the tokenizer.\\n\\nI recommend that the authors rewrite the paper entirely by reformulating the research questions and detailing the experimental method precisely.\\n\\nLast but not least, the paper is not anonymized. Indeed, in two cases, the authors explicitly refer to their previous works (line 126: 'We already discussed 126 elsewhere (Delmonte, 2021)..',  and footnote 5 '5We comment and analyze in depth all sentences in a paper..'), which is against the double-blind reviewing policy.\",\n",

The complexity of the sentences is operationalised via the genre of the text (new vs poetry); in particular via frequency of the word as well as word order/semantics. \\n\\nWhile this is an interesting and pertinent investigation, I am afraid the way the paper is written makes it extremely difficult to understand the experimental setup, the key hypothesis and the results. For example, at no point in the paper do the author clearly state how the masked word prediction task is operationalized. The authors state \"To this aim we ran BERT by masking each content word and some function word, ... \" -- what does masking some function word mean? Relatedly, it is unclear if while making a prediction, the model has access to the right context of the masked word. This is important because the model is being compared to how humans predict a word. Human word prediction is incremental in nature where only the left context is used to make upcoming prediction.\\n\\nIn addition, the work is not contextualised in the larger psycholinguistic prediction literature; the current citations in section 2 is cursory at best.\\n\\nMy suggestion would be that the authors should completely rewrite the paper by making the research questions, the experimental method and the results more accessible.\\n\\nFinally, the submission to the CMCL workshop has to be anonymous and self citations have to be avoided -- the authors write \"We already discussed elsewhere (Delmonte, 2021) that languages like Italian, which have a rich morphology, ...\"; such a statement is a clear violation of the guidelines.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This paper proposed to train a sub-word language model with differentially private federated learning from the targeting task, and then use the trained model to generate/sample words to build the word-level tokenizer.

Empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms heavy-hitters algorithm both in terms of privacy and utility.\\n\\nIn general this paper is well written, with enough background knowledge explained for readers to understand. The motivation is also clear and the algorithm description makes sense. Here are some comments I have to improve the work:\\n- The authors should clearly clarify what type of privacy the proposed method is protecting. It seems that client-level privacy is enforced and a trustworthy server is assumed. I feel it is important to explicitly state this so that it is clear where the clipping and noise is happening in the FL algorithm.\\n- It seems from that the proposed method outperforms heavy hitters algorithm even omitting the extra privacy budget induced by the latter. Could the authors provide the exact \\\\epsilon and \\\\delta for the heavy hitters algorithm? Alternatively, could the authors show the utility performance difference given the same privacy budget, including the separate privacy budget, in order to see how much the proposed method outperforms the former.\\n- There are two minor questions during training a sub-word tokenizer: 1. How does it encode the word when there are multiple sub word combinations? Does it simply search for the one that appears earliest in the dictionary? 2. When updating model embeddings with sub-words, it doesn't seem to be a bijection: different combinations of subwords could result in the same summation, causing words with different semantic meanings to be mapped to the same embedding.

The goal of this paper is to improve the tokenizer using the samples matching the real distribution of the data without incurring an additional PFL budget. The basic idea is to start with a tokenized from a public dataset, which might not match real data, and then improve that tokenizer using samples obtained from the trained model. After that, replace the old tokenizer with the new one and repeat this process. Evaluations show good results on Reddit and StackOverflow datasets. \\n\\n1. To apply it to real-world use cases, it’s a bit unclear when we should start sampling the trained model and using the new tokenizer. Experiments shown in Section 5.4 seem to suggest that there is no easy answer, and it might depend on the underlying dataset and algorithm. Given that, any suggestions on how ML practitioners can adopt this? I assume they cannot try multiple options and pick the best one because that would require an additional budget?\\n2. The experiments seem to be conducted with a fixed budget. I am curious to learn how the proposed algorithm compares with baselines if we got the chance to increase the budget to hit a target perplexity?\\n3. The evaluation results look good. I am curious if the improvements can also be proven in theory as well. And is it possible to quantify the improvements before training? \\n4. Are there any limitations of the proposed algorithm?\\n5. IIUC, before replacing the old tokenizer with the new one, we will need to pause the current process, and use samples from the model to train the new tokenizer. In practice, how long does it take to bring the new tokenizer to a reasonable state, and will this delay be an issue? \\n6. Is it viable to allocate some dedicated budget to train the tokenizer, say 20%? Is there any estimation of how the proposed algorithm compares to that?\\n',\n",

While having a matched tokenizer is essential, training tokenizer on the private client is quite challenging and can potentially cause additional privacy leakage over the existing leakage from DP based FL. Hence, the authors propose a new protocol that samples new datasets for tokenizer up dation using the language model trained using the DP based FL itself. This additional step is integrated into the existing federated learning protocol, and the authors claim that there is no additional privacy leakage. Experiments with many settings are provided that demonstrate that the proposed schemes can match the language model performance of the federated training with oracle tokenizer.\\n\\nWhile the problem considered is interesting and relevant, and the algorithm also has some novelty, the claim that there is no additional privacy leakage is not proved formally. In particular, when the tokenizer is modified during the private federated learning, it essentially splits the training into different stages with their own DP guarantees. I don't think the post-processing guarantee of DP applies in such a scenario. A composition analysis to bound the DP privacy budget is needed.\",\n",

In section 2 it would be better to create a table with all the notations you use throughout your work for faster notation indexing. Section 2.2 \"the data is averaged\", please change to \"gradients or weights are averaged\". Related Work: Federated Learning, please add some discussion on recent works on weight and gradient pruning in federated settings (e.g., [1], [2]). Please elaborate more on the concept of reconciliation; it is not clear what it is and what its challenges are (maybe pointing to specific lines of the algorithm will be helpful). In your time-varying gradient compression it is not clear why we need twice the bandwidth for downlink and where do the $\\\\theta^{final}$ stems from. For the choice of the compression matrix, why do you need an entire Dxd matrix and not consider the model parameters as a collection of smaller dense matrices? Figures 1 and 2 need to come before table 2 since they are discussed first in the paper. Also you compare against LocalTop-K but you never presented or discussed the technique in the paper.\\n\\nPlease be consistent with your notation, for instance in the static intrinsic gradient compression algorithm why use $\\\\mathcal{L}$ as loss. In section 2.1 wouldn\\'t it be more appropriate to replace $\\\\theta_2$ with $\\\\theta^\\\\prime$; also does it hold that $T < L$? Moreover, why refer to $\\\\ell$ as a task when it has already been defined as loss, maybe another symbol could resolve this. A couple notations and concepts used in algorithm 1 are never presented in the paper (e.g., $A(\\\\sum_{t-1}$) - no need for parenthesis, $z_j$, sketches). In section 3, shouldn\\'t be $A\\\\theta^\\\\prime + \\\\theta_0$ instead of $A\\\\theta^\\\\prime$ in the subscript of function f in the first line of equations? Also, how did you derive the A transpose multiplied with the gradient transpose from the previous line and in equation (5) why is $A\\\\theta_{t+1}^\\\\prime$ equal to $\\\\theta_{t+1}$?\\n\\n\\n[1] Jiang, Yuang, Shiqiang Wang, Victor Valls, Bong Jun Ko, Wei-Han Lee, Kin K.

Essentially, it has been known in theoretical ML that in the overall parameter space of the ML model, there is an intrinsic subspace, with potentially much smaller dimension than the model parameter space, where optimization can be carried out. Exploiting this concept and related ideas on intrinsic dimension, the authors propose a set of three novel strategies that enables compression of updates communicated between the FL server and clients, reducing the communication load dramatically. The underlying idea is to use a projection matrix for compression at the clients/decompression at the server, so that both training and global update can be done in the model parameter space while communications can be done in the lower dimensional space. The first algorithm considers the projection matrix to be fixed throughout training, the other two consider different versions of variable projection matrices. Multiple experiments for NLP and vision tasks have been presented that demonstrate reasonable drop in accuracy even for very high (>1000x) compression rates.',\n",

DP says that removal of any point should result in roughly the same model, however from the proposed method not all the points are equal, e.g. some datapoints experience more noise than others. Therefore the proposed algorithm will not be differentially private.\\n2. Noise is correlated against a pre-trained model assuming that the training dataset is also correlated with the dataset that the pre-trained model was trained on. For example, let's assume that the dataset that I want to train my model on contains password recovery questions and answers from the users -- any common phrase (from the pre-trained dataset) will then receive less noise, but since all of those pass answers are sensitive then it will violate privacy of these secret answers. This is the weird case, as you wouldn't want to train such a model but hopefully it shows that now the guarantees depend on some pre-trained model with a custom dataset.\\n\\nLastly the performance results in Table 1 demonstrate that if you increase privacy budget epsilon then the results improve which is trivially obvious.

It empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of the attack with a simple 3 clients-model.

       "     'review': \"This paper proposed a novel reconstruction attack method to infer the client's data utilizing the model updates in a knowledge graph setting. The proposed method achieves strong attacking accuracy on previous baselines. To overcome this, the authors further proposed a new method called FedR robust to the proposed reconstruction attack method. \\n\\nThe method is interesting. The idea of sharing relation embedding rather than head/tail embedding for aggregation is novel and seems to effectively prevent exact inference of the user data. The experimental results seem strong and significantly outperform prior work on multiple benchmarks. Here are some of my concerns:\\n- Rather than saying the proposed FedR is 'privacy-preserving', it seems that FedR is only robust to the proposed attacking method. There are a couple of things missing here: 1. How does the success rate of the attacking method transfer to the privacy level of the randomized algorithm to train KG? Could it transfer to any formal differential privacy guarantee? 2. How to evaluate the optimality of the attack evaluated in this work? Could there be stronger, defense-aware attack that could similarly break FedR? It would be great if the authors could provide additional details for these points.\\n- Could the authors add a related work/background section to list relevant work on reconstruction attacks/FL on KG?\\n- Could the authors add a clear algorithm description on FedR?\\n- In the description of experiment, the authors claim each dataset is randomly split among clients? Does that mean the data are homogeneous among all the clients? In a typical FL setting, data are heterogeneous on each client. Could the authors add experiments on experiments under heterogenous data?\",\n",

There are issues in presentation and claims which can be improved and fixed. Hopefully, discussions at the workshop can help authors gather more feedback and continue their work.\\n\\n\\nBelow are some comments which I hope authors will find useful to improve their work.\\n\\nIt seems that authors are proposing to modify the FL setting, by assuming that server might collude with the clients. This is a modified definition of privacy for FL which is fine and interesting. However, in the abstract and introduction, authors seem to claim that they have found a severe privacy leakage for FedE method and they want to address that severe shortcoming. Contribution of this paper can be explained more clearly starting with the assumptions used in FL literature, FedE method, and authors\\' method.\\n\\nStatements like \"FedE is not privacy-preserving\" are meaningless without proper definition of \"privacy\". From authors\\' point of view, how many of the methods in FL literature can be considered \"privacy-preserving\"?\\n\\nPhrases like \"much more\" for communication efficiency seem to be overly vague.\\n\\nFunction f(h,r,t) is not defined properly.\\n\\nIt is not clear what authors mean by \"honest-but-curious\" server. If the server is honest why should we go through all these trouble to hide the data? Authors have to define what they mean by \"honest\" and how that affects their formulation.\\n\\nIf a client is a traitor and shares the data with the server, why would it share only a percentage of its data and not all of it?\\n\\nMethod is not presented in a coherent way. First, it is mentioned that \"To guarantee the data privacy in the FedE, FEDR adopts two main strategies\". Despite this guarantee, a paragraph later, it is mentioned that \"the server still can roughly infer the relation by comparing the uploaded relation embedding with the one stored...\". It is not clear what \"roughly\" entails here and how it can combine with the statements before. It sounds like authors do not have a clear definition of privacy in mind, are they are putting bandaids on various shortcomings that they consider. The word \"guarantee\" seem to lose its meaning.\\n\\nFigure 4 which provides the comparison with other methods does not depict the performance of proposed method. In the legend, proposed method is shown as a solid black line, but in the plot, there is no such line.',\n",

These techniques allow training large language models in cross-device federated configurations. They show that quantizing the models before uploading and downloading can reduce training costs with marginal drops in performance. \\n\\n### Main Observations:\\n- Model quantization before uploading from local learners is more effective than quantizing before downloading to the local learner.  \\n- Partial variable training combined with quantization further reduces the training and communication load.\\n- Transfer learning or pretraining can speed up federated training.\\n\\n## Suggestions:\\nOverall, I like the paper's analysis of different options available for scaling up federated training for language models and the paper is well-written. However, it still lacks comparison with prior works and baselines. For example, an alternative approach to PVT could be model pruning.

       "     'review': '## Summary\\n\\nThis paper proposes learning a personalized sentiment analysis model from the text by appending or prepending a user-specific string (termed \"UserIdentifier\") to the input text. Then a single transformer model is finetuned on data from all the individuals. Incorporating user identifiers help learn a better and more personalized model for each individual. The proposed method is compared with three other approaches --- finetuning with original data, finetuning with original data followed by prefix-tuning, and finetuning with trainable user identifiers. The authors justified their choice of selecting user-identifiers by appropriate ablation experiments. The \"UserIdentifier\" approach outperforms other baselines on Yelp, Sent140, and IMDB datasets. \\n\\n## Strengths:\\n- Although the solution builds upon recent findings that demonstrate parameter efficient finetuning/few-shot learning by prompting with task-specific texts or introducing trainable input embeddings, the idea of introducing user-specific strings is interesting. \\n- I appreciate that the authors discussed different ways to assign user-identifiers and tried to partially explain the best choice in Sec A.3 and 4.3.\\n- The paper also studied generalization to new users briefly. Interestingly, the model performance is almost similar to finetuning with no user-identifiers (though slightly lower), thus providing personalization without hurting. \\n\\n\\n## Scope for Improvement:\\n- **Federated vs. Centralized Setups**: \\nSince we are eventually interested in a federated setup and personalized models, one of the baselines would be training a model per user, which is missing. While this may not be parameter efficient, each user will train its model on their local machine saving massive communication costs and maybe using similar or compute. The authors should discuss this scenario in the paper at least.  \\n- **Writing**:\\n     - a. The main paper is mainly motivated by federated learning & need for personalized models, but the experiments are performed in a centralized setup which is ok. However, this is not clarified until sec 4. It would be nice to have this clarified in the introduction. \\n     - b. Sec 4.3 last paragraph ignores the L parameter in the discussion. The overlap will be much less even with just L=2 and sample space=400.\\nMinor: Table 4 is in the appendix. Either use a different numbering convention or add a small note in brackets that it is in the appendix. \\n- **Trainable Embeddings**:\\nIt is counterintuitive that fixed prefixes outperform trainable embeddings, as Li & Liang (2021) and Hambardzumyan et al. (2021) show that it outperforms fixed prefixes. Even though the above references are not in the same context, ideally, more flexibility should help improve the model training. This raises the question if this can be explained by overfitting?

Within the \\nproposed section it would also be better to discuss how your approach is compared to the experimental \\nbaselines so that non-expert readers can understand the trade-offs of the different approaches. Moreover,\\nin equation (1) it is not clear how the definitions are derived (sum over posterior distributions?). Also, \\nhow is the local objective equation (3) derived?

Is it the local update rule presented in equation (4)?\\n\\n(W2) Equally weighted FedAvg seems to provide the same performance as AdaPerFL in the wake-word detection task. \\nSimilar for the DITTO-e. Can the authors elaborate more on these results? Moreover, there do not seem to be any \\nimprovements on the sentiment analysis task both in terms of testing and training performance. Maybe, it would\\nhave been better to demonstrate the results as in the case of the Alexa Audio domain by randomly sampling a set\\nof clients from the available pool of 772 clients and showing the performance of the global and personalized \\nmodels on a test dataset.

What is the distribution\\nof training/valid/test sets at each client (s/th like {\\'train\\': #, \\'valid\\': #, \\'test\\': #} would be appropriate) in this task?\\nMoreover, your proposed method is an adaptive learning approach, what is the distribution of local steps per client in your\\nexperiments? Is there a particular range of local step values that each client or all clients follow? To assign the local steps\\nto each client do you use the empirical estimations of equations (11) and (12) in equation (7)?

With this framework, the paper gives theoretical insights into how PFL performance can be maximized by the proper initialization, number of local steps, and global model aggregation. Empirical experiments are done on Alexa Audio Data and Sent140 Data for validation of the proposed algorithm.\\n\\nPros: \\n- The paper looks at an important problem of personalization in FL in the views of Bayesian models which has not been looked into a lot before.\\n- The paper is clear to read including the mathematical notations and description of the algorithms. \\n- The paper gives a concrete analysis into what kind of parameters (initialization, local steps, and aggregation) affect the personalized FL performance in a Bayesian framework and the exact forms of those parameters to maximize personalized FL performance.\\n- The paper includes empirical validation on two different datasets.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Although the theoretical insights are interesting, they are very difficult to implement in practice due to the pre-knowledge on the variance (uncertainty) for deciding the initialization and local steps. However, despite this difficulty, the AdaPerFL that the paper proposes is able to use the sample-variance to circumvent this problem and achieve reasonable performance, thus managing to compensate for this drawback. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "     'review': 'The paper presents a new attack extension of the embedding attack on NLP models to FL. Instead of training to optimize the whole model the attacker only focuses on a small single embedding of an unpopular token. \\n\\nI really liked the idea and think that it has a good potential impact, however I have a couple of concerns:\\n\\n1. Motivation -- FL in NLP is motivated by a smart keyboard application and therefore language generation task. I did not understand motivation under seq2seq tasks, neither summarization nor translation seem like would be good candidates for FL as there are no privacy constraints. I can understand classification, but not on the news dataset (which is hardly private) but rather some toxicity dataset.\\n\\n2. Experiments -- some details on seq2seq task would be great otherwise it\\'s unclear what task exactly gets evaluated (I assume it\\'s a summarization task as it uses ROUGE but still not clear). \"Trigger range\" discussion is also complex as it wasn\\'t introduced before. \\n\\n3. Novelty -- the backdoor attacks on embeddings exist in literature as well as backdoor attacks on FL. Seems like it\\'s a trivial operation to apply one to another. I cannot see why 3.3 is novel as it\\'s the core assumption in all other backdoor FL papers -- other participants contributions can be ignored when computing backdoored model update.\\n\\nIn my opinion the key interesting part of the paper is that it can possibly evade norm-bound detection by modifying only a small model\\'s embedding vector, however it has a very trivial way to defend -- simply check for norm updates of each embedding vector. \\n\\nOverall, I really like the idea but it needs more solid motivation and exploration.

The technical content is reasonably presented, and the ideas are worth discussing at the workshop.\\n\\nAt the same time, there are critical issues:\\n - Readability for all but a small expert circle is substandard, as the paper is devoid of examples\\n - The analysis is narrow, on a single idiosyncratic KG, ConceptNet. The proposed methods would gain much credibility if shown to work not only on that, but also, e.g., on Quasimodo, Atomic, or Ascent.\\n - There is no analysis of system outputs, only aggregate numbers. I understand that human evaluations of this task are hard, but I honestly wonder whether the authors ever looked at their data themselves. There should at least be hand-picked comparisons of system outputs. Are there any human insights on how the proposed methods do better (if they do)?\\n - The reported gains are small, and it is unclear whether they are statistically significant. Having worked on this setting myself, I am skeptical of suggestions that CSKGs truly help in the problem (and the result tables should show a no-KG baseline). Moreover, there seem to be confounding factors, as different methods produce KGs of different size, which make attributing gains to the proposed methods even harder - perhaps the gains just come from finding the sweet spot of right KG size? \\n\\nMinor points:\\n - The term \"schema graph\" appears odd. \"Schema\" to me rather refers to data organization, not to actual grounded triples.\\n - \"We make our code available at anonymous\" - This isn\\'t helpful - there are enough ways nowadays to anonymously share actual files, at a workshop I don\\'t expect code sharing anyway, but at a conference I would not let this pass (if code/data sharing was a requirement).',\n",

Their results show that the larger model, as expected, yields substantial improvements over the base. Interestingly, they find that the question specific COMET relations can provide substantial improvements for both base and large models, with additional possible gains when asking the model to also generate COMET relation type.  So, they augment a large model with noisy hints from COMET and find that this improves performance on the  task. \\n\\nOverall this is decent work.

       "     'review': '### Paper Summary:\\n\\nThis paper focuses on improving GPT-3\\'s performance post-deployment, without any retraining, via a growing repository of interactive user feedback. Through correcting GPT-3\\'s misunderstanding of question intent via a key-value store of user questions and corrective feedback, the authors develop a system to edit prompts through such feedback from previously-asked, similar questions.\\n\\nEvaluating on 4 tasks (lexical relations, word scrambling, and 2 variations of ethics reasoning), the authors show that their method of maintaining a growing memory store coupled with dynamically injecting feedback into prompts is useful in improving GPT-3\\'s accuracy over time.\\n\\n\\n### Paper Strengths:\\n\\nThis paper takes a simple but effective step towards post-deployment error correction. Given that retraining (or, sometimes even large scale finetuning) may not always be tractable, the authors\\' conceptual framework of a lookup table for previously committed errors is straightforward and task-independent. \\n\\nIn addition, incorporating direct user feedback in future model interactions helps to improve interpretability of model output and the model\\'s usability, given that small errors in intent understanding can be corrected post-hoc.\\n\\n\\n### Paper Weaknesses:\\n\\n1. Evaluation of feedback: Given that the prompt is directly edited using feedback provided by users, it would be helpful to understand the model\\'s sensitivity to the user feedback. For example, analysis of lexical sensitivity, robustness to noise in feedback, or other such analysis of user-provided feedback that did not aid accuracy/performance would help to understand the practical implications of using this framework with GPT-3. \\n2. Evaluation of \"u\": Likewise, for more complex questions or tasks, it seems like a more thorough evaluation of the generated question intent (via something like a human evaluation study) would be useful. Given that this approach is using humans in the loop, robust evaluation of the model\\'s “understanding” of the task and the sensitivity/role of user feedback would help contextualize the limitations or practical applications of the approach.\\n3. Scalability: The key-value store (and thus the retrieval component) plays an instrumental role in the performance of the overall system design, but, to my knowledge, the paper does not include a discussion of the scalability of their approach. Given that the memory is simply expected to accumulate over time, this feels like an important dimension of analysis or discussion.\\n\\n\\n### Overall assessment\\n\\nOverall, I think this paper is a nice step towards post-hoc correction of models with humans in the loop, and could be incredibly effective in certain practical settings.\\n\\n### Typos\\n\\n1.

       "     'review': 'The presented work proposes a straight-forward method for improving the performance of pre-trained LMs (PLMs) on a variety of tasks through corrective feedback. The feedback is first supplied by a (simulated) user and stored in a memory component. In the main experiments, such feedback contains information that is intended to correct the model\\'s faulty reasoning, e.g. by elaborating on or clarifying the task that the user is expecting the model to perform. The feedback memory can subsequently be used as a source of additional information for new queries to the model, whereby corrective feedback is retrieved from the memory that was previously provided for queries that are most similar to the current one. The query and the retrieved feedback are subsequently combined with the task-specific prompt and given to the PLM as input, which has empirically been found to outperform baselines that either do no utilize the corrective memory at all, or employ a non-selective memory module. The experimental section includes lexical as well as ethical reasoning tasks, although the authors also describe the application of the proposed method to code-switched question answering and question answering with label feedback (as opposed to natural language corrections).\\n\\nOverall. the proposed method is compelling, easy to implement, and effective according to the provided experimental evaluation. The corrective feedback memory is a neat idea for leveraging and re-using user feedback in an efficient manner and could potentially be applied to many diverse tasks.\\n\\nThere are some minor issues with the paper that should be corrected:\\n- Line 180: The notation is confusing  - does x_i/j represent the input or the error? \\n- Line 308: It would be appropriate to provide citation for Social Chemistry 101, as well.\\n- Figure 3: Some of the example questions / templates are oddly phrased, e.g. \"on the lines of\" which should probably be either \"in the vein of\" or \"along the lines of\"? Could the authors clarify?\\n- Line 379: I assume this should be \"cosine similarity\" rather than \"cosine distance\", as the latter with a threshold of 0.9 would be extremely permissive.\\n- Line 385: Concatenation is not a gating function (while gating may be explored in the future, it is not part of the presented approach); relatedly, the breakdown of the approach in section 3.1. makes it sound more complex than it actually is and is detrimental to the paper\\'s clarity (e.g. both the \"prompter\" and the \"combiner\" are simple concatenation steps and don\\'t really need extra terminology attached to them).\\n- Line 428: improves -> improve\\n- Table 2: Should be positioned under 4.1.1 header and does not have to include the GROW-PROMPT row. \\n- Figure 4: Should get a better caption, e.g. one that explains that the legend denotes the likelihood of feedback being drawn from memory, as it does not to be explicitly stated anywhere else.\\n- Figure 5: The authors should address why feedback retrieval likelihood of 0.5 performs similar to or better than 1.0.\\n- Figure 6, caption: Should be \"for GROW-PROMPT and MEM-PROMPT\".\\n\\nIn closing, I think this paper is really neat, fits well within the body of commonsense reasoning research, and would be a worthy addition to the workshop.',\n",

       "     'review': '# Summary\\nThis work investigates the augmentation of pretrained language models (LMs) with knowledge graphs (KGs) for the cause-effect relation classification and commonsense causal reasoning tasks. They verbalize the ATOMC-2020 KG triples into natural language which they use to continually pretrain BERT. Their results show that the continually pretrained LM outperforms non-continually pretrained ones on two commonsense causal reasoning benchmarks, COPA and BCOPA-CE, and a Temporal and Causal Reasoning (TCR) dataset.\\n\\n# Contributions\\n1. They study pretrained LMs augmented with the ATOMIC-2020 knowledge graph in the commonsense reasoning domain.\\n2. They perform experiments to show that these augmented LMs can outperform non-continually pretrained ones and other baselines on the cause-effect relation classification and commonsense causal reasoning tasks.\\n\\n# Pros\\n1. The writing is generally very clear, which makes the paper easy to follow.\\n2. The result on the TCR task looks very good!\\n3. Approach the (causal) commonsense reasoning task, which is very important.\\n\\n# Cons\\n1. The framework of continually pertaining LMs using verbalized KG triples is something that has been done previously [1]. The only things that are different in this paper is to apply this technique to a different KG (ATOMIC-2020) and to fine-tune on a few different tasks and benchmarks. So there is a lack of novelty.\\n2. I find the result in Table 4 unsatisfactory. First, what is the b-l-reg baseline and why does the ATOMIC-BERT model underperform that baseline? Second, the fact that using all the categories for ATOMIC-2020 actually hurt performance but only using the event ones does not fit well with the claim of the paper that general commonsense knowledge helps the causal commonsense reasoning task. It may just be the case that the event triples in ATOMIC-2020 is in a closer domain to the BCOPA-CE and it is actually the in-domain further pertaining that is helping. Third, why not just try using the causal relations in ATOMIC-2020 (\"cause\", \"effect\" etc)?\\n3. The standard deviations are not reported for all the experimental results.\\n4. I know it is not a fair comparison to compare ATOMIC-BERT and T5 and DeBERTa, but looking at the latter two\\'s numbers on the COPA-test, the task seems a solved one. I am not sure how significant/useful it is to continue working on this benchmark.\\n\\n# Other comments and questions\\n1. An ablation study in the effect of different ways to verbalize the KG triples and e.g. whether the grammar correction step is necessary can be useful and interesting.\\n2. Which split of ATOMIC-2020 is used?\\n\\n# References\\n1.

       "     'review': 'Summary\\n- The technique of continually pretraining language models on commonsense knowledge graph triples has been shown useful for some downstream tasks, but it may depend on the specific domain and tasks. This work investigates the effect of this technique on the task of cause-effect relation classification. The authors verbalize the ATOMIC2020 knowledge graph and continue to pretrain BERT-large on it. The authors show that this simple method can boost the performance in cause-effect classification. \\n\\nReasons to Accept:\\n- The effect of commonsense knowledge graphs for cause-effect relation classification is an interesting topic, but has not been studied systematically. This work performs an interesting investigation into this research question.\\n- The paper is clear and well-written overall. \\n- The authors will publicly release the knowledge graph verbalization codes and the trained models\\n\\nWeakness and questions:\\n- Overall, I think that the experiments/analyses could be polished a bit more. Below are s few suggestions.\\n- ATOMIC-BERT-large (Event, Physical, Social relations) underperforms the baseline BERT-large on two datasets (Table 2, 4). It\\'d be great if the authors could investigate more into why this is the case. Do Physical/Social relations have very different distributions of knowledge than the tasks of interest (i.e. cause-effect prediction)? Even though ATOMIC-BERT-large (Event) outperforms the baseline, it is a bit concerning that in order for the proposed method to work, it needs to identify what kinds of relations within ATOMIC2020 is useful or hurting for the task and remove the hurting relations. It\\'d be ideal if the authors could think about a bit more elegant method to address this issue.\\n- Additionally, it is not clear why adding prompt helps for BCOPA-CE but hurts for COPA task. It\\'d be great if the authors could conduct more in-depth analysis for their results. \\n\\nTypos/grammar:\\n- L184: redundant parenthesis in \"(MLM)\"?\\n',\n",

Their\\nsetup is to pair a small knowledge graph with each question that\\ncontains the relevant knowledge to answer the question. They report\\nexperimental results in this setting, showing that their model,\\nJointI, 1) effectively incorporates the knowledge graph information in\\na fewer-shot setting (e.g., 100-1000 points); and 2) transfers between\\ntasks better than if the model didn\\'t have explicit knowledge handed\\nto it.\\n\\nI commend the authors for their attempt to solve a difficult problem:\\nindeed, the distinction between factual knowledge and inference over\\nthat knowledge is rather illspecified in the commonsense domain.  The\\nproposed approach: converting and then augmenting existing QA datasets\\nwith all the knowledge the might need gives a potentially nice\\nsolution to this problem: i.e., by conditioning on \"all of the\\nknowledge\", the algorithms can focus entirely on inference; similarly,\\nby retrieving knowledge as a first step. I also think the results here\\nregarding generalization are quite interesting! Because we expect that\\nthe inference required for commonsense reasoning tasks may be shared,\\nthe transfer results suggest that, moreso than a model without\\nexplicit knowledge provided, an inference-focused model may generalize\\nbetter.\\n\\nMy biggest concern is that I\\'m not entirely convinced that this setup,\\nas the authors claim, fully separates the knowledge versus inference\\nquestion. While the approach makes sense in theory (i.e., conditioning\\non all needed knowledge), 1) there are still pieces of commonsense\\nknowledge required to, e.g., interpret the small KGs that are paired\\nwith each question.

       "     'review': 'This work proposes a method for explainable question-answering for SocialIQA. The explanations are retrieved from ATOMIC, which contains (subject, relation, object) tuples that can provide helpful evidence/explanation for answering the question. The method trains a pipeline of generative models: i) for generating a relevant relation r in ATOMIC that could be useful for predicting the answer, ii) generating the object using r; and finally, iii) generating the answer using the generated + question and context.\\n\\nThe three-step approach achieves results comparable to a pre-trained model, but has the added advantage that it can provide the tuples used for answering the question, possibly adding to the explainability of the model.\\n\\nThe paper presents an interesting case of using KB information for commonsense question answering. \\nHowever, the present version contains several shortcomings in both formulation and experimental design, listed next. \\n\\n* Trivial baselines: The baselines for retrieving knowledge from the external KB are pretty weak. For example, we can train a simple classifier for relation prediction by treating context in SocialIQA and subject in ATOMIC as exchangeable. Then, the prediction of the classifier can be used as an explanation. It appears that such an approach will work, and might be worth experimenting with in the future.\\n\\n* Clarity of presentation: Several important details are unclear. For instance, ATOMIC has tuples (s, r, o), and each QA sample is (c, q, a). As the authors mention, for SOCIAL-IQA, c determines s, but r and o are unknown. However, the method description mentions that the \"object model is learned first.\" How can the object model be learned without (r, c, o) tuples? This also holds for learning the relation model. I suspect it is trained by simply treating s == c in ATOMIC, but this is an important detail that should be made more explicit. Please also see possible corrections in the formulation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Novelty: the main idea of leveraging external knowledge for commonsense reasoning has been explored in several works. The primary differentiation seems to be that the proposed method does not require hand-annotated explanations and uses dynamic KB. The difference with Bosselut 2021 (which the authors mention) is not completely clear. Further, see [1] for an approach that does not require explicit annotation and does not rely on fixed KBs. Overall, better positioning concerning the related work will help understand the core contributions of this work.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Possible corrections in the formulation:\\n\\n1. In the max_ equation, the object model should also condition on the question for the chain rule factorization to work. Currently, there is an implicit assumption that o is independent of q given c, which may or may not be valid. Consequently, the authors may try conditioning on the question in the object model as well. It might improve things! As a side remark, V* is not specified. The notation also changes from $\\\\theta$ to $\\\\theta’’$ without any explanation.\\n\\n2. L224: \"To get an explanation….\" The following equation appears to be incorrect. First, isn\\'t z = (r, o), and thus the explanation should contain both the terms? Second, o is introduced in the equation on the RHS, but there is no marginalization over it. I suspect there\\'s a typo/problem with the formulation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Questions: \\n\\n1. L130: Due to 130 this ambiguity, humans tend to perform explicit 131 reasoning afterwards. Therefore, we consider the 132 explanation to come after an answer being chosen.\\n\\nWhat are the implications of this statement for your method? I don\\'t think that the answer goes back to generating the input?\\n\\n\\nOverall, I think the work highlights an important area of commonsense reasoning and thus will be a useful addition to the workshop. However, I hope the paper improves by adding the clarifications mentioned above.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[1] Madaan, Aman, Niket Tandon, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Peter Clark, Yiming Yang, and Eduard Hovy. \"Think about it!

       "     'review': '# Summary\\nThis work tackles the problem of explainable commonsense QA. They propose a latent-variable model that identifies what type of knowledge from an external knowledge base may be relevant to answering the question, computes the commonsense inferences and predicts the answer. The method can therefore learn to provide posterior rationales for why a certain answer was chosen. Experimental results show that the model can identify the correct reasoning step in twice as many examples compared to an existing unsupervised approach for producing explanations for the socialIQA task, while still maintaining comparable accuracy to end-to-end pretrained models.\\n\\n# Contributions\\n1. Propose an explainable latent-variable commonsense QA model.\\n2. Perform experiments to show that the model can accurately identify the reasoning steps for the socialIQA task, while also maintaining predictive accuracy.\\n\\n# Pros\\n1. Tackle an interesting and important problem: explainability for commonsense reasoning.\\n2. Thorough evaluation of the proposed model, including manually annotating the groundtruth reasoning steps of 500 examples in socialIQA test sets and evaluating the model\\'s accuracy in identifying those reasoning steps.\\n3. The proposed generative model is novel.\\n4. The proposed model can accurately identify ground-truth reasoning steps.\\n\\n# Cons\\n1. The writing is not that clear and the paper is hard to follow in general. Working through an example instead of just showing this plate notation in Figure 1 can help. Restructuring and rewriting of the paper are needed.\\n2. I did not get the general message of the paper until I read it several times. I suggest in your writing you stress that the paper proposes a commonsense QA model that is **explainable**.  At the end of day, the paper proposes a model for commonsense QA. The ability of generate explanations is just one of its characteristics.\\n3. The arguments that humans first reach an answer then work backwards to figure out the commonsense knowledge they use on line 122-132 are not that convincing to me. Maybe switch to a better example.\\n4. Not sure what the \"KB-based\" baseline is for Table 3 even after reading the description on line 251-254. Does \"external KB\" here mean COMET?\\n5. No standard deviations are reported in Table 2.\\n\\n# Other comments and questions\\n1. On line 158, what does \"such that \\\\sum_zP(a,z|c,q)\" mean?\\n2. On line 163-166, I am not sure how this computation is done even if I have read the Bosselut et al 2021 paper.\\n3. The citation on line 189 is misformatted.\\n4. Notation inconsistency for V* (line 159, 161 and 220)\\n',\n",

       "     'review': \"This short paper aims to evaluate DistillBERT and GPT-3’s ability to make human-like pragmatic inferences, such as Scalar Implicature (SI) and Presupposition (Presp), through human behavioral and neural data.\\n\\nIn Section 5, the authors claim that:\\n\\n* DistillBERT has difficulty detecting Presp (a bit far from human rate), and its performance suffers further when fine-tuned on another Presp + Implicature dataset (ImpPress dataset [1]).\\n\\n* DistillBERT has difficulty detecting SI, but its performance improves to human-level when fine-tuned on the ImpPress dataset [1].\\n\\n* GPT-3 does not do well in either psycholinguistic task and fine-tuning helps.\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n* **Online human data motivation:** The paper’s motivation of using human data for conversational implicature is well-grounded. LMs are not trained the same way through many dialogues, but rather with text found on the web.\\n\\n* **Good sanity check on noun co-occurrence:** The authors check whether the test datasets contain enough noun co-occurrence patterns that could make the LM find a likelihood pattern rather than reason to conclude what sentence is more plausible.\\n\\n* **Avoids the pitfall of comparing BERT and GPT-3 with the same metrics:** This is a positive thing as they are trained very differently, and a perplexity comparison would be inconclusive.\\n\\n### Weaknesses\\n\\n* **Important definitions/examples are not very clear:** \\n    - If the reader doesn’t know what SI or Presp is, they are left with definitions and examples that aren’t very clear (ex: [line 50] “by using the determiner ‘the’ most people typically presuppose the existence of such a thing in the context.”) \\n    - Similarly, in [line 142], it seems as if the uniqueness of the waiter affects the context, whereas it’s the relevancy of the job to the place. If one said “a waiter,” the place could be a random location irrelevant to the person who is still unique but happens to hold that job.\\n\\n* **DistillBERT’s SI implicature evaluation setting doesn’t help answer the question:**\\n    - By not penalizing that “some” can be above “all,” in the case where both would be in the top 5 choices, we accept the model’s choice as correct while it isn't.\\n    - It’s not surprising that “all” doesn’t show up as much as other options in the top 5 choices, as the model may put many adjectives like “Dirty,” “Tall,” and so forth. These have nothing to do with the implication, yet they still make sense given that the LM’s learning algorithm uses masked loss. Instead, comparing whether “all” is relatively more likely than “some” is more useful and would lead to more valid conclusions.\\n\\n* **GPT-3’s success criteria calculation is not clear:** [Line 116-122] is a little confusing as to which mean we are calculating. It seems to be that the authors calculate the sequence log probability divided by the sentence length for several sentences and then calculate the mean of those.\\n\\n* **Contradictions in conclusions:** While the results in Section 5 state that GPT-3 doesn’t do very well with psycholinguistic tasks [line 278], the authors say that LMs understand “the implied intent shared among most people” in the abstract [line 019-022]. This is either because I misunderstood something or because even human decisions are as low as the LMs’ rates. Including the human plausibility decision rates in the plots can make it easier to compare with LMs, although the authors may have stated these numbers at [lines 152-154].\\n\\n### Style - points that didn’t affect the decision of acceptance/rejection but could be useful to the authors\\n\\n* This paper may be a single-author paper. It’s still preferred if it’s written with “we” statements instead of “I” statements.\\n\\n* There are many places where previously cited references aren’t referred to with LaTeX again when mentioned, and are instead typed out, which leads to typos (ex: [line 155]). In the future, it may lead to not being able to discern between different articles.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n[1] [Are Natural Language Inference Models IMPPRESsive?

       "     'review': 'What the paper is about: The paper argues that for contextual commonsense inference (commonsense understanding in some story), the GLUCOSE task conflates a different skill of natural language generation, which also brings in the ills of BLEU metrics. They propose the task of CIS2 which instead of asking the model to generate a commonsense inference, merely asks it to pick/classify the correct sentence prediction. They compare with different diagnostics/ablations of the original GLUCOSE task by removing parts of the input. They find that models trained on these ablations of GLUCOSE-Original perform worse than one trained on CIS2 (note that all these variants are based on the same GLUCOSE dataset) -- when evaluating on CIS2 metric of classification.\\n\\nKey Shortcoming: There is no independent evidence that shows a classification task is better than generation task in training for \"contextual commonsense inference.\" The only evidence is on the same metric of CIS2 which seems biased. The argument sounds like \"Standardized Tests are not good benchmarks of creativity, so we propose instead teaching/testing students the skill of playing chess. We find that students preparing for different standardized tests are worse than students preparing for chess -- when evaluated on chess.\" The core hypothesis remains untested: whether chess playing (CIS2) is a better metric and task for creativity (commonsense contextual inference) than standardized testing (generation). Some ways that this could have been evaluated are:\\n1. human studies - do annotators find one model to exhibit more commonsense than others in some way?\\n2. independent downstream task - does the model trained on CIS2 outperform those trained on generation on some third task?

       "     'review': \"This paper critiques existing methods on Contextual Commonsense Inference (CCI), which conflates generation and reasoning tasks. The authors propose reframing the CCI task as a classification task (called Cis2) to isolate commonsense reasoning from the generation. This helps in evaluating the commonsense inference ability of a model irrespective of its generation performance. For this, they convert story sentences into output tags which avoids a partial match between input and output sequences. The model is then required to generate an abstracted output which contains story sentences' tags instead of full sequences. \\n\\nPros:\\n* It is important to evaluate the reasoning abilities of models in isolation from their generation abilities and the author pinpointed a valid issue with original GLUCOSE task formulation.\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n* Most of the findings from the diagnostic tests are obvious and expected (see comments). \\n* Too much content is provided about Mostafazadeh et al. 2020 which could be easily skipped and referred to the original paper.\\n* It is not clear how the newly designed task formulation handles cases where the inference output Y is not explicitly stated in the given story.\\n\\nComments:\\n1- How does your task reformulation handle cases where the inference output Y is not explicitly stated in the story? As the authors mention in Line 196, the CS inference Y might or might not be part of the story. And example from the original GLUCOSE paper is:\\n“Gage wants safety” Causes/Enables “Gage turned his bike”, while “Gage wants safety” is never stated in the story and should be inferred thus can not be replaced by a tag from the story.\\n\\n2- Line 259: while I agree with the authors that the original task formulation suffers from conflation of CCI and language generation tasks, I think this can be solved mostly by 1) removing the selected sentence X from the output, and 2) including a better evaluation metrics that accounts for semantic similarity such as BertScore. \\n\\n3- Line 367-369: Isn't this obvious? if in the training data, output always copy/paraphrase X, it's expected that the model learns this pattern and consequently the BLEU score would be high. The issue is why the model should generate X in the first place. Without including X in the output (no matter if X is in the input or not) the evaluation using n-gram overlap would be less unreliable.\\n\\n4- Line 380: In my opinion copying is an easier task.\\n\\n5- The first 5.5 pages are allocated for background and related work and only on page 6 the author started to talk about their proposed task Cis2. \\n\\n6- It is helpful to explicitly mention somewhere in the paper that you are using a generative classifier where the model GENERATES one of the 100 possible output sequences (using T5) and it’s not a 100-way classification task.\\n\\n7- Line 449: For what portion of the original data could the authors find output Y explicitly mentioned in the input story? And why not discard those with very low similarity scores?\\n\\nTypo: \\n\\nLine 406: the The → The\\n\\nLine 407: footnote after punctuation.\\n\",\n",

The key novelty of the paper is to propose new pre-training tasks masked common sense modeling and commonsense type prediction.

This could be potentially adapted to other related tasks and domains.\\n\\nI really liked the idea of getting commonsense inferences from Visual COMET and then using it in the newly designed pre-training tasks.\\n\\nAlthough I am not fully convinced of the improvements shown in the paper, experiments sufficiently validate the conclusions drawn in the paper.\\n\\n\\nWeaknesses:\\n\\nHere are my major concerns:\\n\\nAuthors showed improvements that are less than 2% in section 4.3. I worked with ViLBERT model before on both VCR and VQA and I found that any improvement < 2% cannot be considered as significant as it could simply be due to the variance in training. It would help (and is necessary) to present results with different seeds to validate the improvements.\\n\\nFor the VQA model, is Visual COMET really required? because most of the questions in VQA are not created to test the temporal aspect of the events. Maybe using the COMET (Jena Hwang et al., AAAI 2021) model might be a good choice here?\\n',\n",

       "     'review': 'This paper aims to improve downstream task performance on commonsense reasoning tasks with a pre-training scheme that involves both recognition and cognition tasks in an automated fashion (i.e., without needing more human annotation for the cognition part). \\n\\nThe paper treats the original MSCOCO [1] captions as “low-level” as they often involve solely recognizing objects/people/events. These low-level captions are augmented to high-level captions by using templates and a visual-linguistic GPT-2 model fine-tuned on VisualCOMET [2] without a <location> sense, but with the rest of the commonsense types such as <before>, <after>, and <intent>. **Therefore the 3 domains they consider in pre-training are: image, low-level captions, and high-level captions.**\\n\\nThe authors propose 3 new tasks/methods. The paper claims these methods improve pretraining incrementally (with VL-BERT) in addition to prior MLM & MRC schemes:\\n\\n* **Masked commonsense modeling (MCM):**\\n    * The task of predicting a masked high-level caption domain token conditioned on the rest of the high-level tokens as well as the visual and low-level caption tokens.\\n    * For the other 2 domains, the authors still use MLM & MRC, conditioned on all 3 domains at the same time.\\n\\n* **Domain-wise adaptive masking:** As the automatically generated high-level captions include parts of the low-level captions, the authors propose to adjust the masking ration between the two captions domains on their semantic similarity (cosine sim w/ BERT embeddings & some more processing).\\n\\n* **Commonsense type prediction (CTP):** The task of predicting the type of the high-level commonsense captions by masking all of the template phrases.\\n\\n\\n### Strengths\\n**Background + motivation well-formulated:** The authors motivate their work well with prior research that separates recognition from cognition. \\n\\n**Novelty:** They push forward that improvement in commonsense understanding has to start from pretraining rather than a fine-tuning scheme, which is a unique approach. They find novel methods to do so, by looking for ways to overcome specialization in a certain type of commonsense knowledge/ability.\\n\\n**Ease of usage / scalability:** Their methods are automated and therefore don’t require more human annotation. Regardless of the automation, the results don\\'t suffer form the basic templates.\\n\\n**Ablation study:** The authors show the possible improvement role of each proposed method.\\n\\n\\n### Weaknesses\\n**Improvement margin:** It’s hard to tell from Table 2 whether the performance has improved vastly (~1% improvements). This gets harder with pre-training schemes combined with fine-tuning. It could be the case that a single point in accuracy improvement does matter. This is the case in many zero-shot learning tasks. However, in this approach the authors finetune on a separate set of the dataset tested. Therefore it’s hard to say whether it’s the finetuning that does most of the work and the pretrained embeddings are luckily well \"initialized\" with respect to the task or whether it actually improves the representations. I think that the human survey helps to back this to a certain extent, and that the method is interesting enough that a small margin doesn’t affect the rest of the paper. However, non-finetuned results on all methods (non-pretrained, recogniton, cognition) or some comments on why this small improvement matters would have been helpful.\\n\\n**A little confused about the edge cases of masking even if it’s domain-wise:** It’s clear that MCM is conditioned on visual + low-level captions only, whereas MLM & MRC are conditioned on all three domains. But it’s a little hard to understand whether they are conditioned all independently or they could be all masked at the same time. For example it’s a little hard to understand from [lines 327-330] whether low-level captions and high-level inferences could be masked both at the same time, because of a combination of domain adaptive masking + MCM. It seems like no, and that’s the point of making sure a connection between images and the high-level captions exists, but it could be confusing to the reader. I think the paper could benefit from a clarification on this.\\n\\n**Similarity of datasets:** It’s clearly stated in the paper that a subset of the VCR dataset is in the VisualCOMET dataset. It’s also stated that the high-level captions from VisualCOMET are mostly related to humans, while there is a \"val-human\" set separated from VQA. I wish there was a little more discussion on why this doesn’t or does affect the results, whether the improvement lies in picking the right datasets or not.\\n\\n### Style\\n**The term commonsensical:** Although I understand that this term is used to separate cognition-level tasks from recognition ones, a reader from a commonsense research background in NLP may be confused (while originally this definition at [line 071] aims to reduce confusion). I would either stick to commonsense and say here we are solely referring to it from a cognitive points of view, or completely let it go and use words related to cognition. I understand that it’s hard to thread around what it might entail.\\n\\n**Backbone citation:** I would change the citation at [line 045] to the actual GPT-2 citation and then move the visual-linguistic pretraining citation of [2] to the end of the sentence, as the rest of the sentence cites the actual backbone papers.\\n\\n### References\\n\\n[1] Lin, Tsung-Yi et al. “Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context.” ECCV (2014).\\n\\n[2] Park, Jae Sung et al. “VisualCOMET: Reasoning About the Dynamic Context of a Still Image.” ECCV (2020).',\n",

The authors present analysis on the dataset indicating the presence of cultural entities/names/etc. that highlight the importance of collecting datasets in the desired language directly rather than simply translating the English dataset.\\n\\nThe authors present results from a number of baseline models---n-gram similarity, fastText embedding similarity, mBERT, and IndoBERT--- on the last-sentence-selection classification task, demonstrating that the naive similarity methods are not significantly better than random, while IndoBERT achieves 81% accuracy, indicating the task is not solved. They perform analysis to show that the dataset does not have the artifacts that the original ROCStories dataset has-- experiments show that the full context (first 4 sentences) is generally needed to achieve the best performance on the classification task. However, I'd ask the authors to acknowledge in the text that the models receiving no context are still far better than the 50% baseline, indicating some form of spurious correlations in the dataset.\\n\\nOn the last-sentence generation task, the authors show that training on both the English + Indonesian data leads to good performance on the Indonesian test set using mBART, according to manual evaluation. They also test zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on the classification task by training and testing on different variants of their dataset (Indonesian), ROCStories (English), and machine translations of each, finding that both the English and Indonesian test sets don't seem to benefit from training on the other language, and including machine translations has mixed effect.\\n\\nThe data is an interesting and novel contribution, and the inclusion of detailed experiments makes promising progress on the task with high-quality analysis. My only concern is that last-sentence prediction and generation from 5-sentence stories are very simplified versions of creative storytelling, and many works in the research area (albeit in English) now focus on harder tasks such as generating entire stories from a single prompt or from scratch on more complex datasets. However I think this resource could be used for such goals and is thus useful to the community as a starting point.\\n\\nPossible missing citation: Abductive Commonsense Reasoning-- a variant of the story cloze task (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Byg1v1HKDB)\\n\\n\",\n",

This paper proposed to train a sub-word language model with differentially private federated learning from the targeting task, and then use the trained model to generate/sample words to build the word-level tokenizer.

Training the tokenizer is an important part of learning a language model (e.g., Transformer and BERT), but to my best knowledge, it is the first work to study how to train the tokenizer in federated learning setting. \\nAlthough the first two contributions (i.e., 1) performance degradation from training with a different distribution and 2) sub-word tokenizer eliminates the out-of-vocabulary problem) are quite obvious, I appreciate this work and advocate accepting the article in this workshop to discuss further. Here are some of my concerns:\\n1.\\tI am confused about the system and privacy model, especially how public (Wiki) and private (Reddit or StackOverflow) dataset is distributed over the server/clients. The authors assume that stale tokenizer is trained with the public dataset with a certain privacy budget. However, if the public dataset is utilized to train the model, why should differential privacy be applied? In addition, who generates dataset by utilizing the stale (or old) tokenizer and who update the model embeddings? Clarification about these questions from the FL perspective can improve the paper.\\n2.\\tIn experiments, it would be better to highlight the paper’s contribution if comparing the two settings in the same privacy budget: 1) proposed scheme (i.e., train old tokenizer with DP and train the new tokenizer without additional privacy budget) and 2) directly train the tokenizer based on private dataset in private FL with the same privacy budget. \\n',\n",

By utilizing the post-processing theorem of differential privacy, the authors claim that the proposed method satisfies DP without additional privacy cost on training the tokenizer. Empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms heavy-hitters algorithm both in terms of privacy and utility.\\n\\nIn general this paper is well written, with enough background knowledge explained for readers to understand. The motivation is also clear and the algorithm description makes sense. Here are some comments I have to improve the work:\\n- The authors should clearly clarify what type of privacy the proposed method is protecting. It seems that client-level privacy is enforced and a trustworthy server is assumed. I feel it is important to explicitly state this so that it is clear where the clipping and noise is happening in the FL algorithm.\\n- It seems from that the proposed method outperforms heavy hitters algorithm even omitting the extra privacy budget induced by the latter. Could the authors provide the exact \\\\epsilon and \\\\delta for the heavy hitters algorithm? Alternatively, could the authors show the utility performance difference given the same privacy budget, including the separate privacy budget, in order to see how much the proposed method outperforms the former.\\n- There are two minor questions during training a sub-word tokenizer: 1. How does it encode the word when there are multiple sub word combinations? Does it simply search for the one that appears earliest in the dictionary? 2. When updating model embeddings with sub-words, it doesn't seem to be a bijection: different combinations of subwords could result in the same summation, causing words with different semantic meanings to be mapped to the same embedding.

The goal of this paper is to improve the tokenizer using the samples matching the real distribution of the data without incurring an additional PFL budget. The basic idea is to start with a tokenized from a public dataset, which might not match real data, and then improve that tokenizer using samples obtained from the trained model. After that, replace the old tokenizer with the new one and repeat this process. Evaluations show good results on Reddit and StackOverflow datasets. \\n\\n1. To apply it to real-world use cases, it’s a bit unclear when we should start sampling the trained model and using the new tokenizer. Experiments shown in Section 5.4 seem to suggest that there is no easy answer, and it might depend on the underlying dataset and algorithm. Given that, any suggestions on how ML practitioners can adopt this? I assume they cannot try multiple options and pick the best one because that would require an additional budget?\\n2. The experiments seem to be conducted with a fixed budget. I am curious to learn how the proposed algorithm compares with baselines if we got the chance to increase the budget to hit a target perplexity?\\n3. The evaluation results look good. I am curious if the improvements can also be proven in theory as well. And is it possible to quantify the improvements before training? \\n4. Are there any limitations of the proposed algorithm?\\n5. IIUC, before replacing the old tokenizer with the new one, we will need to pause the current process, and use samples from the model to train the new tokenizer. In practice, how long does it take to bring the new tokenizer to a reasonable state, and will this delay be an issue? \\n6. Is it viable to allocate some dedicated budget to train the tokenizer, say 20%? Is there any estimation of how the proposed algorithm compares to that?\\n',\n",

       "   'review': \"The authors propose a method to train a 'matched' tokenizer alongside the decentralized and private federated learning of an NLP model over the client data. In particular, the authors consider the problem of having tokenizer for the NLP model that is reflective of the data on the clients that participate in the decentralized federated learning process. When the tokenizer is not matched with the private client, such as when the tokenizer is trained on a public dataset, the authors demonstrate a significant drop in accuracy of the trained model, compared to when using an oracle tokenizer i.e. when the tokenizer is trained on the client data itself. While having a matched tokenizer is essential, training tokenizer on the private client is quite challenging and can potentially cause additional privacy leakage over the existing leakage from DP based FL. Hence, the authors propose a new protocol that samples new datasets for tokenizer up dation using the language model trained using the DP based FL itself. This additional step is integrated into the existing federated learning protocol, and the authors claim that there is no additional privacy leakage. Experiments with many settings are provided that demonstrate that the proposed schemes can match the language model performance of the federated training with oracle tokenizer.\\n\\nWhile the problem considered is interesting and relevant, and the algorithm also has some novelty, the claim that there is no additional privacy leakage is not proved formally. In particular, when the tokenizer is modified during the private federated learning, it essentially splits the training into different stages with their own DP guarantees. I don't think the post-processing guarantee of DP applies in such a scenario. A composition analysis to bound the DP privacy budget is needed.\",\n",
