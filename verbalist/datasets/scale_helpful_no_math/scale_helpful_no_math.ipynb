You can add additional currencies by simply adding them to the constructor\\'s map along with their respective exchange rates. For example, to add Australian Dollar (AUD), you could do this:\\n\\n```java\\nexchangeRates.put(\"AUD\", 1.45);\\n```\\n\\nNote that the above assumes that one AUD is worth roughly 1.45 USD. If that isn\\'t the case, then you would need to look up the actual exchange rate between these two currencies and update the value accordingly.',\n",
