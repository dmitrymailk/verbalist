Grumpy is a synonym for grouchy, so you could watch at Grumpy Old Men for more examples.\\nCrab apples are small apples that are typically wild, that is, they have not been domesticated to be bought and sold. (You can eat them, though.). Crabby is another synonym for grouchy.\\nThis joke is funny because it plays with the word grouchy and it synonyms, like crabby.'}"
