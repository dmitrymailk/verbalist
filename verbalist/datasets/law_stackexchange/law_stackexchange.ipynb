The classic expositions of this issue are by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nagel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thomas Nagel</a>, in his chapter, &quot;<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/%7Evancecd/phil1100/Nagel1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moral Luck</a>&quot; (1979) and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bernard Williams</a>, &quot;<a href=\"https://bibliotecamathom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/williams_-_moral_luck.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moral Luck</a>&quot; (1976).

If there were, he would\\nbe to blame for their deaths, and would probably be prosecuted for\\nmanslaughter. But if he hurts no one, although his recklessness is exactly the\\nsame, he is guilty of a far less serious legal offence and will certainly reproach\\nhimself and be reproached by others much less severely. To take another legal\\nexample, the penalty for attempted murder is less than that for successful\\nmurder – however similar the intentions and motives of the assailant may be\\nin the two cases. His degree of culpability can depend, it would seem, on\\nwhether the victim happened to be wearing a bullet-proof vest, or whether a\\nbird flew into the path of the bullet – matters beyond his control.</p>\\n<p>...</p>\\n<p>... How is it possible to be more or less culpable depending\\non whether a child gets into the path of one’s car, or a bird into the path of\\none’s bullet? Perhaps it is true that what is done depends on more than the\\nagent’s state of mind or intention. The problem then is, why is it not irrational to base moral assessment on what people do, in this broad sense? It\\namounts to holding them responsible for the contributions of fate as well as\\nfor their own – provided they have made some contribution to begin with. ...
